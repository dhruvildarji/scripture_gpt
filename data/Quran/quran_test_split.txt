ased with them, and they are pleased with Him. These are the partisans of Allah. Indeed, it is Allahs partisans who are the successful. . THE MOBILIZATION al-Hashr In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . Glorifying Allah is all that exists in the heavens and the earth. He is the Almighty, the Most Wise. . It is He who evicted those who disbelieved among the People of the Book from their homes at the first mobilization. You did not think they would leave, and they thought their fortresses would protect them from Allah. But Allah came at them from where they never expected, and threw terror into their hearts. They wrecked their homes with their own hands, and by the hands of the believers. Therefore, take a lesson, O you who have insight. . Had Allah not decreed exile for them, He would have punished them in this life. But in the Hereafter they will have the punishment of the Fire. . That is because they opposed Allah and His Messenger. Whoever opposes AllahAllah is stern in retribution. . Whether you cut down a tree, or leave it standing on its trunk, it is by Allahs will. He will surely disgrace the sinners. . Whatever Allah has bestowed upon His Messenger from them; you spurred neither horse nor camel for them, but Allah gives authority to His messengers over whomever He will. Allah is Able to do all things. . Whatever Allah restored to His Messenger from the inhabitants of the villages belongs to Allah, and to the Messenger, and to the relatives, and to the orphans, and to the poor, and to the wayfarer; so that it may not circulate solely between the wealthy among you. Whatever the Messenger gives you, accept it; and whatever he forbids you, abstain from it. And fear Allah. Allah is severe in punishment. . To the poor refugees who were driven out of their homes and their possessions, as they sought the favor of Allah and His approval, and came to the aid of Allah and His Messenger. These are the sincere. . And those who, before them, had settled in the homeland, and had accepted faith. They love those who emigrated to them, and find no hesitation in their hearts in helping them. They give them priority over themselves, even if they themselves are needy. Whoever is protected from his natural greedit is they who are the successful. . And those who came after them, saying, Our Lord, forgive us, and our brethren who preceded us in faith, and leave no malice in our hearts towards those who believe. Our Lord, You are Clement and Merciful. . Have you not considered those who act hypocritically? They say to their brethren who disbelieved among the People of the Book, If you are evicted, we will leave with you, and will not obey anyone against you; and should anyone fight you, we will certainly support you. But Allah bears witness that they are liars. . If they are evicted, they will not leave with them; and if anyone fights them, they will not support them; and if they go to their aid, they will turn their backs and flee; then they will receive no support. . Fear of you is more intense in their hearts than fear of Allah. That is because they are a people who do not understand. . They will not fight you all together except from fortified strongholds, or from behind walls. Their hostility towards each other is severe. You would think they are united, but . THE WOMAN TESTED al-Mumtahina their hearts are diverse. That is because they are a people who do not understand. . Like those shortly before them. They experienced the consequences of their decisions. For them is a painful punishment. . Like the devil, when he says to the human being, Disbelieve. But when he has disbelieved, he says, I am innocent of you; I fear Allah, the Lord of the Worlds. . The ultimate end for both of them is the Fire, where they will dwell forever. Such is the requital for the wrongdoers. . O you who believe! Fear Allah, and let every soul consider what it has forwarded for the morrow, and fear Allah. Allah is Aware of what you do. . And do not be like those who forgot Allah, so He made them forget themselves. These are the sinners. . Not equal are the inhabitants of the Fire and the inhabitants of Paradise. It is the inhabitants of Paradise who are the winners. . Had We sent this Quran down on a mountain, you would have seen it trembling, crumbling in awe of Allah. These parables We cite for the people, so that they may reflect. . He is Allah. There is no god but He, the Knower of secrets and declarations. He is the Compassionate, the Merciful. . He is Allah; besides Whom there is no god; the Sovereign, the Holy, the Peace-Giver, the Faith-Giver, the Overseer, the Almighty, the Omnipotent, the Overwhelming. Glory be to Allah, beyond what they associate. . He is Allah; the Creator, the Maker, the Designer. His are the Most Beautiful Names. Whatever is in the heavens and the earth glorifies Him. He is the Majestic, the Wise. . THE WOMAN TESTED al-Mumtahina In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . O you who believe! Do not take My enemies and your enemies for supporters, offering them affection, when they have disbelieved in what has come to you of the Truth. They have expelled the Messenger, and you, because you believed in Allah, your Lord. If you have mobilized to strive for My cause, seeking My approval, how can you secretly love them? I know what you conceal and what you reveal. Whoever among you does that has strayed from the right way. . Whenever they encounter you, they treat you as enemies, and they stretch their hands and tongues against you with malice. They wish that you would disbelieve. . Neither your relatives nor your children will benefit you on the Day of Resurrection. He will separate between you. Allah is Observant of what you do. . You have had an excellent example in Abraham and those with him; when they said to their people, We are quit of you, and what you worship apart from Allah. We denounce you. Enmity and hatred has surfaced between us and you, forever, until you believe in Allah alone. Except for the words of Abraham to his father, I will ask forgiveness for you, though I have no power from Allah to do anything for you. Our Lord, in You we trust, and to You we repent, and to You is the ultimate resort. . Our Lord, do not make us a target for those who disbelieve, and forgive us, our Lord. You are indeed the Mighty and Wise. . There is an excellent example in them for youfor anyone who seeks Allah and the Last Day. But whoever turns awayAllah is the Self-Sufficient, the Most Praised. . Perhaps Allah will plant affection between you and those of them you consider enemies. Allah is Capable. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. . As for those who have not fought against you for your religion, nor expelled you from your homes, Allah does not prohibit you from dealing with them kindly and equitably. Allah loves the equitable. . COLUMN as-Saff . But Allah prohibits you from befriending those who fought against you over your religion, and expelled you from your homes, and aided in your expulsion. Whoever takes them for friendsthese are the wrongdoers. . O you who believe! When believing women come to you emigrating, test them. Allah is Aware of their faith. And if you find them to be faithful, do not send them back to the unbelievers. They are not lawful for them, nor are they lawful for them. But give them what they have spent. You are not at fault if you marry them, provided you give them their compensation. And do not hold on to ties with unbelieving women, but demand what you have spent, and let them demand what they have spent. This is the rule of Allah; He rules among you. Allah is Knowing and Wise. . If any of your wives desert you to the unbelievers, and you decide to penalize them, give those whose wives have gone away the equivalent of what they had spent. And fear Allah, in whom you are believers. . O prophet! If believing women come to you, pledging allegiance to you, on condition that they will not associate anything with Allah, nor steal, nor commit adultery, nor kill their children, nor commit perjury as to parenthood, nor disobey you in anything righteous, accept their allegiance and ask Allahs forgiveness for them. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. . O you who believe! Do not befriend people with whom Allah has become angry, and have despaired of the Hereafter, as the faithless have despaired of the occupants of the graves. . COLUMN as-Saff In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . Everything in the heavens and the earth praises Allah. He is the Almighty, the Wise. . O you who believe! Why do you say what you do not do? . It is most hateful to Allah that you say what you do not do. . Allah loves those who fight in His cause, in ranks, as though they were a compact structure. . When Moses said to his people, O my people, why do you hurt me, although you know that I am Allahs Messenger to you? And when they swerved, Allah swerved their hearts. Allah does not guide the sinful people. . And when Jesus son of Mary said, O Children of Israel, I am Allahs Messenger to you, confirming what preceded me of the Torah, and announcing good news of a messenger who will come after me, whose name is Ahmad. But when he showed them the miracles, they said, This is obvious sorcery. . And who is a greater wrongdoer than he who attributes falsehoods to Allah, when he is being invited to Islam? Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people. . They want to extinguish Allahs Light with their mouths; but Allah will complete His Light, even though the disbelievers dislike it. . It is He who sent His Messenger with the guidance and the true religion, to make it prevail over all religions, even though the idolaters dislike it. . O you who believe! Shall I inform you of a trade that will save you from a painful torment? . That you believe in Allah and His Messenger, and strive in the cause of Allah with your possessions and yourselves. That is best for you, if you only knew. . He will forgive you your sins; and will admit you into gardens beneath which rivers flow, and into beautiful mansions in the Gardens of Eden. That is the supreme success. . And something else you love: support from Allah, and imminent victory. So give good news to the believers. . FRIDAY al-Jumuah . O you who believe! Be supporters of Allah, as Jesus son of Mary said to the disciples, Who are my supporters towards Allah? The disciples said, We are Allahs supporters. So a group of the Children of Israel believed, while another group disbelieved. We supported those who believed against their foe, so they became dominant. . FRIDAY al-Jumuah In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . Everything in the heavens and the earth glorifies Allah the Sovereign, the Holy, the Almighty, the Wise. . It is He who sent among the unlettered a messenger from themselves; reciting His revelations to them, and purifying them, and teaching them the Scripture and wisdom; although they were in obvious error before that. . And others from them, who have not yet joined them. He is the Glorious, the Wise. . That is Allahs grace, which He grants to whomever He wills. Allah is Possessor of limitless grace. . The example of those who were entrusted with the Torah, but then failed to uphold it, is like the donkey carrying works of literature. Miserable is the example of the people who denounce Allahs revelations. Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people. . Say, O you who follow Judaism; if you claim to be the chosen of Allah, to the exclusion of the rest of mankind, then wish for death if you are sincere. . But they will not wish for it, ever, due to what their hands have advanced. Allah knows well the wrongdoers. . Say, The death from which you flee will catch up with you; then you will be returned to the Knower of the Invisible and the Visible, and He will inform you of what you used to do. . O you who believe! When the call is made for prayer on Congregation Day, hasten to the remembrance of Allah, and drop all business. That is better for you, if you only knew. . Then, when the prayer is concluded, disperse through the land, and seek Allahs bounty, and remember Allah much, so that you may prosper. . Yet whenever they come across some business, or some entertainment, they scramble towards it, and leave you standing. Say, What is with Allah is better than entertainment and business; and Allah is the Best of providers. . THE HYPOCRITES al-Munafiqun In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . When the hypocrites come to you, they say, We bear witness that you are Allahs Messenger. Allah knows that you are His Messenger, and Allah bears witness that the hypocrites are liars. . They treat their oaths as a cover, and so they repel others from Allahs path. Evil is what they do. . That is because they believed, and then disbelieved; so their hearts were sealed, and they cannot understand. . When you see them, their appearance impresses you. And when they speak, you listen to what they say. They are like propped-up timber. They think every shout is aimed at them. They are the enemy, so beware of them. Allah condemns them; how deluded they are! . And when it is said to them, Come, the Messenger of Allah will ask forgiveness for you, they bend their heads, and you see them turning away arrogantly. . It is the same for them, whether you ask forgiveness for them, or do not ask forgiveness for them; Allah will not forgive them. Allah does not guide the sinful people. . GATHERING at-Taghabun . It is they who say: Do not spend anything on those who side with Allahs Messenger, unless they have dispersed. To Allah belong the treasures of the heavens and the earth, but the hypocrites do not understand. . They say, If we return to the City, the more powerful therein will evict the weak. But power belongs to Allah, and His Messenger, and the believers; but the hypocrites do not know. . O you who believe! Let neither your possessions nor your children distract you from the remembrance of Allah. Whoever does that these are the losers. . And give from what We have provided for you, before death approaches one of you, and he says, My Lord, if only You would delay me for a short while, so that I may be charitable, and be one of the righteous. . But Allah will not delay a soul when its time has come. Allah is Informed of what you do. . GATHERING at-Taghabun In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . Everything in the heavens and the earth praises Allah. To Him belongs the Kingdom, and to Him all praise is due, and He is Able to do all things. . It is He who created you. Some of you are unbelievers, and some of you are believers. And Allah perceives what you do. . He created the heavens and the earth with truth, and He designed you, and designed you well, and to Him is the final return. . He knows everything in the heavens and the earth, and He knows what you conceal and what you reveal. And Allah knows what is within the hearts. . Has the news not reached you, of those who disbelieved before? They tasted the ill consequences of their conduct, and a painful torment awaits them. . That is because their messengers came to them with clear explanations, but they said, Are human beings going to guide us? So they disbelieved and turned away. But Allah is in no need. Allah is Independent and Praiseworthy. . Those who disbelieve claim that they will not be resurrected. Say, Yes indeed, by my Lord, you will be resurrected; then you will be informed of everything you did; and that is easy for Allah. . So believe in Allah and His Messenger, and the Light which We sent down. Allah is Aware of everything you do. . The Day when He gathers you for the Day of Gatheringthat is the Day of Mutual Exchange. Whoever believes in Allah and acts with integrity, He will remit his misdeeds, and will admit him into gardens beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein forever. That is the supreme achievement. . But as for those who disbelieve and denounce Our revelationsthese are the inmates of the Fire, dwelling therein forever; and what a miserable fate! . No disaster occurs except by Allahs leave. Whoever believes in Allah, He guides his heart. Allah is Aware of everything. . So obey Allah, and obey the Messenger. But if you turn awayit is only incumbent on Our Messenger to deliver the clear message. . Allah, there is no god but He; and in Allah let the believers put their trust. . O you who believe! Among your wives and your children are enemies to you, so beware of them. But if you pardon, and overlook, and forgiveAllah is Forgiver and Merciful. . Your possessions and your children are a test, but with Allah is a splendid reward. . So be conscious of Allah as much as you can, and listen, and obey, and give for your own good. He who is protected from his stinginessthese are the prosperous. . DIVORCE at-Talaq . If you lend Allah a good loan, He will multiply it for you, and will forgive you. Allah is Appreciative and Forbearing. . The Knower of the Unseen and the Seen, the Almighty, the Wise. . DIVORCE at-Talaq In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . O Prophet! If any of you divorce women, divorce them during their period of purity, and calculate their term. And be pious before Allah, your Lord. And do not evict them from their homes, nor shall they leave, unless they have committed a proven adultery. These are the limits of Allahwhoever oversteps Allahs limits has wronged his own soul. You never know; Allah may afterwards bring about a new situation. . Once they have reached their term, either retain them honorably, or separate from them honorably. And call to witness two just people from among you, and give upright testimony for Allah. By that is exhorted whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day. And whoever fears AllahHe will make a way out for him. . And will provide for him from where he never expected. Whoever relies on Allah He will suffice him. Allah will accomplish His purpose. Allah has set a measure to all things. . As for those of your women who have reached menopause, if you have any doubts, their term shall be three monthsand also for those who have not menstruated. As for those who are pregnant, their term shall be until they have delivered. Whoever fears AllahHe will make things easy for him. . This is the ordinance of Allah, which He sent down to you. Whoever fears AllahHe will remit his sins, and will amplify his reward. . Allow them to reside where you reside, according to your means, and do not harass them in order to make things difficult for them. If they are pregnant, spend on them until they give birth. And if they nurse your infant, give them their payment. And conduct your relation in amity. But if you disagree, then let another woman nurse him. . The wealthy shall spend according to his means; and he whose resources are restricted shall spend according to what Allah has given him. Allah never burdens a soul beyond what He has given it. Allah will bring ease after hardship. . How many a town defied the command of its Lord and His messengers? So We held it strictly accountable, and We punished it with a dreadful punishment. . It tasted the result of its decisions, and the outcome of its decisions was perdition. . Allah has prepared for them a severe retribution. So beware of Allah, O you who possess intellect and have faith. Allah has sent down to you a Reminder. . A messenger who recites to you Allahs Verses, clear and distinct, that he may bring those who believe and work righteousness from darkness into light. Whoever believes in Allah and acts with integrity, He will admit him into gardens beneath which rivers flow, therein to abide forever. Allah has given him an excellent provision. . Allah is He Who created seven heavens, and their like of earth. The command descends through them, so that you may know that Allah is Capable of everything, and that Allah Encompasses everything in knowledge. . PROHIBITION at-Tahrim In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . O prophet! Why do you prohibit what Allah has permitted for you, seeking to please your wives? Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. . SOVEREIGNTY al-Mulk . Allah has decreed for you the dissolution of your oaths. Allah is your Master. He is the All-Knowing, the Most Wise. . The Prophet told something in confidence to one of his wives. But when she disclosed it, and Allah made it known to him; he communicated part of it, and he avoided another part. Then, when he informed her of it, she said, Who informed you of this? He said, The All-Knowing, the All-Informed, informed me. . If you repent to Allah, then your hearts have listened. But if you band together against him, then Allah is his Ally, as is Gabriel, and the righteous believers. In addition, the angels will assist him. . Perhaps, if he divorces you, his Lord will give him in exchange wives better than you: submissive, believing, obedient, penitent, devout, fastingpreviously married, or virgins. . O you who believe! Protect yourselves and your families from a Fire, whose fuel is people and stones. Over it are angels, fierce and powerful. They never disobey Allah in anything He commands them, and they carry out whatever they are commanded. . O you who disbelieved! Make no excuses today. You are being repaid for what you used to do. . O you who believe! Repent to Allah with sincere repentance. Perhaps your Lord will remit your sins, and admit you into gardens beneath which rivers flow, on the Day when Allah will not disappoint the Prophet and those who believed with him. Their light streaming before them, and to their right, they will say, Our Lord, complete our light for us, and forgive us; You are capable of all things. . O prophet! Strive hard against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be stern with them. Their abode is Hell. What a miserable destination! . Allah illustrates an example of those who disbelieve: the wife of Noah and the wife of Lot. They were under two of Our righteous servants, but they betrayed them. They availed them nothing against Allah, and it was said, Enter the Fire with those who are entering. . And Allah illustrates an example of those who believe: the wife of Pharaoh, when she said, My Lord, build for me, with you, a house in Paradise, and save me from Pharaoh and his works, and save me from the wrongdoing people. . And Mary, the daughter of Imran, who guarded her womb, and so We breathed into her of Our Spirit; and she believed in the truth of her Lords Words and His Books, and was one of the devout. . SOVEREIGNTY al-Mulk In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . Blessed is He in whose hand is the sovereignty, and Who has power over everything. . He who created death and lifeto test youas to which of you is better in conduct. He is the Almighty, the Forgiving. . He who created seven heavens in layers. You see no discrepancy in the creation of the Compassionate. Look again. Can you see any cracks? . Then look again, and again, and your sight will return to you dazzled and exhausted. . We have adorned the lower heaven with lanterns, and made them missiles against the devils; and We have prepared for them the punishment of the Blaze. . For those who reject their Lord, there is the torment of Hell. What an evil destination! . When they are thrown into it, they will hear it roaring, as it seethes. . It almost bursts with fury. Every time a batch is thrown into it, its keepers will ask them, Has no warner come to you? . THE PEN al-Qalam . They will say, Yes, a warner did come to us, but we disbelieved, and said, Allah did not send down anything; you are very much mistaken. . And they will say, Had we listened or reasoned, we would not have been among the inmates of the Blaze. . So they will acknowledge their sins. So away with the inmates of the Blaze. . As for those who fear their Lord in secret for them is forgiveness and a great reward. . Whether you keep your words secret, or declare themHe is Aware of the inner thoughts. . Would He not know, He Who created? He is the Refined, the Expert. . It is He who made the earth manageable for you, so travel its regions, and eat of His provisions. To Him is the Resurgence. . Are you confident that the One in heaven will not cause the earth to collapse beneath you as it spins? . Or are you confident that the One in Heaven will not unleash against you a violent storm? Then you will know what My warning is like. . Those before them also denied the truth; and how was My disapproval? . Have they not seen the birds above them, spreading their wings, and folding them? None holds them except the Compassionate. He is Perceiver of everything. . Or who is this who is a force for you to protect you against the Compassionate? The disbelievers are in nothing but delusion. . Or who is this that will provide for you, if He withholds His provision? Yet they persist in defiance and aversion. . Is he who walks bent on his own design better guided, or he who walks upright on a straight path? . Say, It is He who produced you; and made for you the hearing, and the vision, and the organs. But rarely do you give thanks. . Say, It is He who scattered you on earth, and to Him you will be rounded up. . And they say, When will this promise be fulfilled, if you are truthful? . Say, Knowledge is with Allah, and I am only a clear warner. . But when they see it approaching, the faces of those who disbelieved will turn gloomy, and it will be said, This is what you used to call for. . Say, Have you considered? Should Allah make me perish, and those with me; or else He bestows His mercy on us; who will protect the disbelievers from an agonizing torment? . Say, He is the Compassionate. We have faith in Him, and in Him we trust. Soon you will know who is in evident error. . Say, Have you considered? If your water drains away, who will bring you pure running water? . THE PEN al-Qalam In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . Noon. By the pen, and by what they inscribe. . By the grace of your Lord, you are not insane. . In fact, you will have a reward that will never end. . And you are of a great moral character. . You will see, and they will see. . Which of you is the afflicted. . Your Lord knows best who has strayed from His path, and He knows best the well-guided. . So do not obey the deniers. . They would like you to compromise, so they would compromise. . And do not obey any vile swearer. . Backbiter, spreader of slander. . THE PEN al-Qalam . Preventer of good, transgressor, sinner. . Rude and fake besides. . Just because he has money and children. . When Our Verses are recited to him, he says, Myths of the ancients! . We will brand him on the muzzle. . We tested them, as We tested the owners of the garden, when they vowed to harvest it in the morning. . Without any reservation. . But a calamity from your Lord went around it while they slept. . And in the morning it was as if picked. . In the morning, they called to one another. . Go early to your plantation, if you are going to harvest. . So off they went, murmuring to one another. . No poor person is to enter it upon you today. . And early they went, resolved in intent. . But when they saw it, they said, We were wrong. . We are now deprived. . The most reasonable of them said, Did I not say to you, if only you would glorify? . They said, Glory to our LordWe were indeed in the wrong. . Then they turned to one another, blaming one another. . They said, Woe to uswe were indeed domineering. . Perhaps our Lord will give us a better substitute for it. We are turning to our Lord. . Such is the punishment; but the punishment of the Hereafter is greater, if they only knew. . For the righteous are Gardens of Delight with their Lord. . Shall We treat the Muslims like the villains? . What is the matter with you? How do you judge? . Or do you have a scripture in which you study. . Wherein there is whatever you choose? . Or do you have oaths from Us, binding until the Day of Resurrection, that you will have whatever you demand? . Ask them, which of them will guarantee that. . Or do they have partners? Then let them produce their partners, if they are truthful. . On the Day when the Shin will be exposed, and they will be called to bow down, but they will be unable. . Their eyes subdued, shame will cover them. They were invited to bow down when they were sound. . So leave Me to those who reject this discourse; We will proceed against them gradually, from where they do not know. . And I will give them respite. My plan is firm. . Or do you ask them for a fee, so they are burdened with debt? . Or do they know the future, and so they write it down? . So wait patiently for the Decision of your Lord, and do not be like the Fellow of the Fish who cried out in despair. . Were it not for his Lords favor that reached him, he would have been thrown into the wilderness, fully despised. . But his Lord chose him, and made him one of the righteous. . Those who disbelieve almost stab you with their glances when they hear the message, and say, He is crazy! . But it is no less than a reminder to all the Worlds. . THE REALITY al-Haqqah . THE REALITY al-Haqqah In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . The Reality. . What is the Reality? . What will make you understand what the Reality is? . Thamood and Aad denied the Catastrophe. . As for Thamood, they were annihilated by the Overwhelming. . And as for Aad; they were annihilated by a furious, roaring wind. . He unleashed it upon them for seven nights and eight days, in succession. You could see the people tossed around, as though they were stumps of hollow palm-trees. . Can you see any remnant of them? . Then Pharaoh came, and those before him, and the Overturned Cities steeped in sin. . But they disobeyed the messenger of their Lord, so He seized them with an overpowering grip. . When the waters overflowed, We carried you in the cruising ship. . To make it a lesson for youso that retaining ears may retain it. . Then, when the Trumpet is sounded a single time. . And the earth and the mountains are lifted up, and crushed, with a single crush. . On that Day, the Event will come to pass. . And the heaven will crack; so on that Day it will be frail. . And the angels will be ranged around its borders, while eight will be carrying the Throne of your Lord above them that Day. . On that Day you will be exposed, and no secret of yours will remain hidden. . As for him who is given his book in his right hand, he will say, Here, take my book and read it. . I knew I would be held accountable. . So he will be in pleasant living. . In a lofty Garden. . Its pickings are within reach. . Eat and drink merrily for what you did in the days gone by. . But as for him who is given his book in his left hand, he will say, I wish I was never given my book. . And never knew what my account was. . If only it was the end. . My money cannot avail me. . My power has vanished from me. . Take him and shackle him. . Then scorch him in the Blaze. . Then in a chain which length is seventy cubits tie him up. . For he would not believe in Allah the Great. . Nor would he advocate the feeding of the destitute. . So he has no friend here today. . And no food except scum. . Which only the sinners eat. . Indeed, I swear by what you see. . And by what you do not see. . It is the speech of a noble messenger. . And it is not the speech of a poetlittle do you believe. . Nor is it the speech of a soothsayerlittle do you take heed. . It is a revelation from the Lord of the Worlds. . Had he falsely attributed some statements to Us. . We would have seized him by the right arm. . WAYS OF ASCENT al-Maarij . Then slashed his lifeline. . And none of you could have restrained Us from him. . Surely, it is a message for the righteous. . And We know that some of you will reject it. . And it is surely a source of grief for the unbelievers. . Yet it is the absolute truth. . So glorify the name of your Lord, the Magnificent. . WAYS OF ASCENT al-Maarij In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . A questioner questioned the imminent torment. . For the disbelievers; none can repel it. . From Allah, Lord of the Ways of Ascent. . Unto Him the angels and the Spirit ascend on a Day the duration of which is fifty thousand years. . So be patient, with sweet patience. . They see it distant. . But We see it near. . On the Day when the sky will be like molten brass. . And the mountains will be like tufted wool. . No friend will care about his friend. . They will be shown each other. The criminal wishes he would be redeemed from the punishment of that Day by his children. . And his spouse, and his brother. . And his family that sheltered him. . And everyone on earth, in order to save him. . By no means! It is a Raging Fire. . It strips away the scalps. . It invites him who once turned his back and fled. . And accumulated and hoarded. . Man was created restless. . Touched by adversity, he is fretful. . Touched by good, he is ungenerous. . Except the prayerful. . Those who are constant at their prayers. . And those in whose wealth is a rightful share. . For the beggar and the deprived. . And those who affirm the Day of Judgment. . And those who fear the punishment of their Lord. . Their Lords punishment is not to be taken for granted. . And those who guard their chastity. . Except from their spouses or those living under their control, for then they are free of blame. . But whoever seeks to go beyond that these are the transgressors. . And those who honor their trusts and their pledges. . And those who stand by their testimonies. . And those who are dedicated to their prayers. . These will be honored in Gardens. . What is with those who disbelieve, stretching their necks towards you. . From the right, and from the left, banding together? . Is every one of them aspiring to be admitted into a Garden of Bliss? . No indeed! We created them from what they know. . I swear by the Lord of the Easts and the Wests, that We are Able. . NOAH Nuh . To replace them with better than they, and We are not to be outdone. . So leave them to blunder and play, until they meet their Day which they are promised. . The Day when they will emerge from the tombs in a rush, as though they were hurrying towards a target. . Their eyes cast down; overwhelmed by humiliation. This is the Day which they were promised. . NOAH Nuh In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . We sent Noah to his people: Warn your people before there comes upon them a painful punishment. . He said, O my people, I am to you a clear warner. . Worship Allah and reverence Him, and obey me. . And He will forgive you of your sins, and reprieve you until a stated term. Allahs term cannot be deferred once it has arrived, if you only knew. . He said, My Lord, I have called my people night and day. . But my call added only to their flight. . Whenever I called them to Your forgiveness, they thrust their fingers into their ears, and wrapped themselves in their garments, and insisted, and became more and more arrogant. . Then I called them openly. . Then I appealed to them publicly, and I spoke to them privately. . I said, Ask your Lord for forgiveness; He is Forgiving. . He will let loose the sky upon you in torrents. . And provide you with wealth and children, and allot for you gardens, and allot for you rivers. . What is the matter with you, that you do not appreciate Allahs Greatness? . Although He created you in stages. . Do you not realize that Allah created seven heavens in layers? . And He set the moon in their midst for light, and He made the sun a lamp. . And Allah germinated you from the earth like plants. . Then He will return you into it, and will bring you out again. . And Allah made the earth a spread for you. . That you may travel its diverse roads. . Noah said, My Lord, they have defied me, and followed him whose wealth and children increase him only in perdition. . And they schemed outrageous schemes. . And they said, Do not give up your gods; do not give up Wadd, nor Souwa, nor Yaghoos, and Yaooq, and Nassr. . They have misled many, so do not increase the wrongdoers except in confusion. . Because of their wrongs, they were drowned, and were hurled into a Fire. They did not find apart from Allah any helpers. . Noah said, My Lord, do not leave of the unbelievers a single dweller on earth. . If You leave them, they will mislead your servants, and will breed only wicked unbelievers. . My Lord! Forgive me and my parents, and anyone who enters my home in faith, and all the believing men and believing women; and do not increase the wrongdoers except in perdition. . THE JINN al-Jinn In the name of Allah, . THE ENWRAPPED al-Muzzammil the Gracious, the Merciful . Say, It was revealed to me that a band of jinn listened in, and said, We have heard a wondrous Quran. . It guides to rectitude, so we have believed in it; and we will never associate anyone with our Lord. . And Exalted is the Grandeur of our Lord He never had a mate, nor a child. . But the fools among us used to say nonsense about Allah. . And we thought that humans and jinn would never utter lies about Allah. . Some individual humans used to seek power through some individual jinn, but they only increased them in confusion. . They thought, as you thought, that Allah would never resurrect anyone. . We probed the heaven, and found it filled with stern guards and projectiles. . We used to take up positions to listen in; but whoever listens now finds a projectile in wait for him. . We do not know whether ill is intended for those on earth, or if their Lord intends goodness for them. . Some of us are righteous, but some of us are less than that; we follow divergent paths. . We realized that we cannot defeat Allah on earth, and that we cannot escape Him by fleeing. . And when we heard the guidance, we believed in it. Whoever believes in his Lord fears neither loss, nor burden. . Among us are those who are submitting, and among us are the compromisers. As for those who have submittedit is they who pursue rectitude. . But as for the compromisersthey will be firewood for Hell. . Had they kept true to the Path, We would have given them plenty water to drink. . To test them with it. Whoever turns away from the remembrance of his Lord, He will direct him to torment ever mounting. . The places of worship are for Allah. So do not call, besides Allah, upon anyone else. . And when the servant of Allah got up calling on Him, they almost fell on him in a mass. . Say, I pray only to my Lord, and I never associate anyone with Him. . Say, It is not in my power to harm you, nor to bring you to right conduct. . Say, No one can protect me from Allah, and I will not find any refuge except with Him. . Except for a proclamation from Allah and His messages. He who defies Allah and His Messengerfor him is the Fire of Hell, in which they will dwell forever. . Until, when they see what they were promised, they will know who is weaker in helpers, and fewer in numbers. . Say, I do not know whether what you are promised is near, or whether my Lord will extend it for a period. . The Knower of the Invisible; He does not disclose His Invisible to anyone. . Except to a Messenger of His choosing. He then dispatches guards before him and behind him. . That He may know that they have conveyed the messages of their Lord. He encompasses what they have, and has tallied everything by number. . THE ENWRAPPED al-Muzzammil In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . O you Enwrapped one. . Stay up during the night, except a little. . For half of it, or reduce it a little. . THE ENROBED al-Muddathir . Or add to it; and chant the Quran rhythmically. . We are about to give you a heavy message. . The vigil of night is more effective, and better suited for recitation. . In the daytime, you have lengthy work to do. . So remember the Name of your Lord, and devote yourself to Him wholeheartedly. . Lord of the East and the West. There is no god but He, so take Him as a Trustee. . And endure patiently what they say, and withdraw from them politely. . And leave Me to those who deny the truth, those of luxury, and give them a brief respite. . With Us are shackles, and a Fierce Fire. . And food that chokes, and a painful punishment. . On the Day when the earth and the mountains tremble, and the mountains become heaps of sand. . We have sent to you a messenger, a witness over you, as We sent to Pharaoh a messenger. . But Pharaoh defied the Messenger, so We seized him with a terrible seizing. . So how will you, if you persist in unbelief, save yourself from a Day which will turn the children gray-haired? . The heaven will shatter thereby. His promise is always fulfilled. . This is a reminder. So whoever wills, let him take a path to his Lord. . Your Lord knows that you stay up nearly two-thirds of the night, or half of it, or onethird of it, along with a group of those with you. Allah designed the night and the day. He knows that you are unable to sustain it, so He has pardoned you. So read of the Quran what is possible for you. He knows that some of you may be ill; and others travelling through the land, seeking Allahs bounty; and others fighting in Allahs cause. So read of it what is possible for you, and observe the prayers, and give regular charity, and lend Allah a generous loan. Whatever good you advance for yourselves, you will find it with Allah, better and generously rewarded. And seek Allahs forgiveness, for Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. . THE ENROBED al-Muddathir In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . O you Enrobed one. . Arise and warn. . And magnify your Lord. . And purify your clothes. .And abandon abominations. . And show no favor seeking gain. . And be constant for your Lord. . When the Trumpet is blown. . That Day will be a difficult day. . For the disbelieversnot easy. . Leave Me to him whom I created alone. . And gave him vast wealth. . And children as witnesses. . And smoothed things for him. . Then he wants Me to add yet more! . By no means! He was stubborn towards Our revelations. . I will exhaust him increasingly. . He thought and analyzed. . May he perish, how he analyzed. . Again: may he perish, how he analyzed. . Then he looked. . Then he frowned and whined. . Then he turned back and was proud. . And said, This is nothing but magic from the past. . This is nothing but the word of a mortal. . RESURRECTION al-Qiyamah . I will roast him in Saqar. . But what will explain to you what Saqar is? . It neither leaves, nor spares. . It scorches the flesh. . Over it are Nineteen. . We have appointed only angels to be wardens of the Fire, and caused their number to be a stumbling block for those who disbelieve; so that those given the Scripture may attain certainty; and those who believe may increase in faith; and those given the Scripture and the believers may not doubt; and those in whose hearts is sickness and the unbelievers may say, What did Allah intend by this parable? Thus Allah leads astray whom He wills, and guides whom He wills. None knows the soldiers of your Lord except He. This is nothing but a reminder for the mortals. . Nay! By the moon. . And the night as it retreats. . And the morning as it lights up. . It is one of the greatest. . A warning to the mortals. . To whomever among you wishes to advance, or regress. . Every soul is hostage to what it has earned. . Except for those on the Right. . In Gardens, inquiring. . About the guilty. . What drove you into Saqar? . They will say, We were not of those who prayed. . Nor did we feed the destitute. . And we used to indulge with those who indulge. . And we used to deny the Day of Judgment. . Until the Inevitable came upon us. . But the intercession of intercessors will not help them. . Why are they turning away from the Reminder? . As though they were panicked donkeys. . Fleeing from a lion? . Yet every one of them desires to be given scrolls unrolled. . No indeed! But they do not fear the Hereafter. . Nevertheless, it is a reminder. . So whoever wills, shall remember it. . But they will not remember, unless Allah wills. He is the Source of Righteousness, and the Source of Forgiveness. . RESURRECTION al-Qiyamah In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . I swear by the Day of Resurrection. . And I swear by the blaming soul. . Does man think that We will not reassemble his bones? . Yes indeed; We are Able to reconstruct his fingertips. . But man wants to deny what is ahead of him. . He asks, When is the Day of Resurrection? . When vision is dazzled. . And the moon is eclipsed. . And the sun and the moon are joined together. . On that Day, man will say, Where is the escape? . No indeed! There is no refuge. . To your Lord on that Day is the settlement. . On that Day man will be informed of everything he put forward, and everything he left behind. . And man will be evidence against himself. . MAN al-Insan . Even as he presents his excuses. . Do not wag your tongue with it, to hurry on with it. . Upon Us is its collection and its recitation. . Then, when We have recited it, follow its recitation. . Then upon Us is its explanation. . Alas, you love the fleeting life. . And you disregard the Hereafter. . Faces on that Day will be radiant. . Looking towards their Lord. . And faces on that Day will be gloomy. . Realizing that a back-breaker has befallen them. . Indeed, when it has reached the breastbones. . And it is said, Who is the healer? . And He realizes that it is the parting. . And leg is entwined with leg. . To your Lord on that Day is the drive. . He neither believed nor prayed. . But he denied and turned away. . Then he went to his family, full of pride. . Woe to you; and woe. . Then again: Woe to you; and woe. . Does man think that he will be left without purpose? . Was he not a drop of ejaculated semen? . Then he became a clot. And He created and proportioned? . And made of him the two sexes, the male and the female? . Is He not Able to revive the dead? . MAN al-Insan In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . Has there come upon man a period of time when he was nothing to be mentioned? . We created man from a liquid mixture, to test him; and We made him hearing and seeing. . We guided him to the way, be he appreciative or unappreciative. . We have prepared for the faithless chains, and yokes, and a Searing Fire. . But the righteous will drink from a cup whose mixture is aroma. . A spring from which the servants of Allah will drink, making it gush abundantly. . They fulfill their vows, and dread a Day whose ill is widespread. . And they feed, for the love of Him, the poor, and the orphan, and the captive. . We only feed you for the sake of Allah. We want from you neither compensation, nor gratitude. . We dread from our Lord a frowning grim Day. . So Allah will protect them from the ills of that Day, and will grant them radiance and joy. . And will reward them for their patience with a Garden and silk. . Reclining therein on the thrones; experiencing therein neither sun, nor frost. . Its shade hovering over them, and its fruit brought low within reach. . Passing around them are vessels of silver, and cups of crystal. . Crystal of silverthey measured them exactly. . They will be served therein with a cup whose flavor is Zanjabeel. . A spring therein named Salsabeel. . Passing among them are eternalized youths. If you see them, you would think them sprinkled pearls. . THE UNLEASHED al-Mursalat . Wherever you look, you see bliss, and a vast kingdom. . Upon them are garments of green silk, and satin. And they will be adorned with bracelets of silver. And their Lord will offer them a pure drink. . This is a reward for you. Your efforts are well appreciated. . It is We who sent down the Quran upon youa gradual revelation. . So be patient for the decision of your Lord, and do not obey the sinner or the blasphemer among them. . And mention the Name of your Lord, morning and evening. . And for part of the night, prostrate yourself to Him, and glorify Him long into the night. . As for these: they love the fleeting life, and leave behind a Heavy Day. . We created them, and strengthened their frame; and whenever We will, We can replace them with others like them. . This is a reminder; so whoever wills, let him take a path to his Lord. . Yet you cannot will, unless Allah wills. Allah is Knowing and Wise. . He admits into His mercy whomever He wills. But as for the wrongdoers, He has prepared for them a painful punishment. . THE UNLEASHED al-Mursalat In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . By those unleashed in succession. . Storming turbulently. . Scattering far and wide. . Separating decisively. . Delivering a message. . Excusing or warning. . Surely what you are promised will happen. . When the stars are obliterated. . And the sky is fractured. . And the mountains are blown away. . And the messengers are alerted. . Until which day is it deferred? . Until the Day of Decision. . And what will teach you what the Day of Decision is? . Woe on that Day to the liars. . Did We not destroy the ancients? . Then succeeded them with the others? . This is how We deal with the guilty. . Woe on that Day to the rejecters. . Did We not create you from an insignificant fluid? . Then lodged it in a secure place? . For a known term? . We measured precisely. We are the best to measure. . Woe on that Day to the falsifiers. . Did We not make the earth a homestead? . For the living and the dead? . And set on it lofty mountains, and given you pure water to drink? . Woe on that Day to the deniers. . Proceed to what you used to deny. . Proceed to a shadow of three different masses. . Offering no shade, and unavailing against the flames. . It shoots sparks as castles. . As if they were yellow camels. . Woe on that Day to the liars. . This is a Day when they will not speak. . And they will not be allowed to apologize. . Woe on that Day to the rejecters. . This is the Day of Separation; We have gathered you, together with the ancients. . THE EVENT an-Naba . So if you have a strategy, use it against Me. . Woe on that Day to the falsifiers. . The righteous will be amidst shades and fountains. . And fruits as they desire. . Eat and drink pleasantly, for what you used to do. . This is how We reward the doers of good. . Woe on that Day to the deniers. . Eat and enjoy yourselves a little; you are indeed criminals. . Woe on that Day to the liars. . And when it is said to them, Kneel, they do not kneel. . Woe on that Day to the rejecters. . In what message, beyond this, will they believe? . THE EVENT an-Naba In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . What are they asking one another about? . About the Great Event. . About which they disagree. . Surely, they will find out. . Most certainly, they will find out. . Did We not make the earth a cradle? . And the mountains pegs? . And created you in pairs? . And made your sleep for rest? . And made the night a cover? . And made the day for livelihood? . And built above you seven strong ones? . And placed a blazing lamp? . And brought down from the clouds pouring water? . To produce with it grains and vegetation? . And luxuriant gardens? . The Day of Sorting has been appointed. . The Day when the Trumpet is blown, and you will come in droves. . And the sky is opened up, and becomes gateways. . And the mountains are set in motion, and become a mirage. . Hell is lying in ambush. . For the oppressors, a destination. . Where they will remain for eons. . They will taste therein neither coolness, nor drink. . Except boiling water, and freezing hail. . A fitting requital. . For they were not anticipating any reckoning. . And they denied Our signs utterly. . But We have enumerated everything in writing. . So taste! We will increase you only in suffering. . But for the righteous there is triumph. . Gardens and vineyards. . And splendid spouses, well matched. . And delicious drinks. . They will hear therein neither gossip, nor lies. . A reward from your Lord, a fitting gift. . Lord of the heavens and the earth, and everything between themThe Most Mercifulnone can argue with Him. . On the Day when the Spirit and the angels stand in row. They will not speak, unless it be one permitted by the Most Merciful, and he will say what is right. . That is the Day of Reality. So whoever wills, let him take a way back to his Lord. . We have warned you of a near punishmentthe Day when a person will observe . THE SNATCHERS an-Naziat what his hands have produced, and the faithless will say, O, I wish I were dust. . THE SNATCHERS an-Naziat In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . By those who snatch violently. . And those who remove gently. . And those who glide smoothly. . And those who race swiftly. . And those who regulate events. . On the Day when the Quake quakes. . And is followed by the Successor. . Hearts on that Day will be pounding. . Their sights downcast. . They say, Are we to be restored to the original condition? . When we have become hollow bones? . They say, This is a losing proposition. . But it will be only a single nudge. . And they will be awake. . Has the story of Moses reached you? . When His Lord called out to him in the sacred valley of Tuwa. . Go to Pharaohhe has transgressed. . And say, Do you care to be cleansed? . And I will guide you to your Lord, and you will turn reverent. . He showed him the Greatest Miracle. . But he denied and defied. . Then turned his back, and tried. . And gathered and proclaimed. . He said, I am your Lord, the most high. . So Allah seized him with an exemplary punishment, in the last and in the first. . In this is a lesson for whoever fears. . Are you more difficult to create, or the heaven? He constructed it. . He raised its masses, and proportioned it. . And He dimmed its night, and brought out its daylight. . And the earth after that He spread. . And from it, He produced its water and its pasture. . And the mountains, He anchored. . A source of enjoyment for you and for your animals. . But when the Great Cataclysm arrives. . A Day when man will remember what he has endeavored. . And Hell will be displayed to whoever sees. . As for him who was defiant. . And preferred the life of this world. . Then Hell is the shelter. . But as for him who feared the Standing of his Lord, and restrained the self from desires. . Then Paradise is the shelter. . They ask you about the Hour, When will it take place? . You have no knowledge of it. . To your Lord is its finality. . You are just a warner for whoever dreads it. . On the Day when they witness itas though they only stayed an evening, or its morning. . HE FROWNED Abasa In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . He frowned and turned away. . When the blind man approached him. . But how do you know? Perhaps he was seeking to purify himself. . THE ROLLING at-Takwir . Or be reminded, and the message would benefit him. . But as for him who was indifferent. . You gave him your attention. . Though you are not liable if he does not purify himself. . But as for him who came to you seeking. . In awe. . To him you were inattentive. . Do not. This is a Lesson. . Whoever wills, shall remember it. . On honorable pages. . Exalted and purified. . By the hands of scribes. . Noble and devoted. . Perish man! How thankless he is! . From what did He create him? . From a sperm drop He created him, and enabled him. . Then He eased the way for him. . Then He puts him to death, and buries him. . Then, when He wills, He will resurrect him. . But no, he did not fulfill what He has commanded him. . Let man consider his food. . We pour down water in abundance. . Then crack the soil open. . And grow in it grains. . And grapes and herbs. . And olives and dates. . And luscious gardens. . And fruits and vegetables. . Enjoyment for you, and for your livestock. . But when the Deafening Noise comes to pass. . The Day when a person will flee from his brother. . And his mother and his father. . And his consort and his children. .

Your friend is not possessed. . He saw him on the luminous horizon. . And He does not withhold knowledge of the Unseen. . And it is not the word of an accursed devil. . So where are you heading? . It is only a Reminder to all mankind. . To whoever of you wills to go straight. . But you cannot will, unless Allah wills The Lord of the Worlds. . THE SHATTERING al-Infitar In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . When the sky breaks apart. . When the planets are scattered. . When the oceans are exploded. . When the tombs are strewn around. . Each soul will know what it has advanced, and what it has deferred. . O man! What deluded you concerning your Lord, the Most Generous? .

They know everything you do. . The virtuous will be in bliss. . While the wicked will be in Hell. . They will enter it on the Day of Justice. . And they will not be absent from it. . But what will convey to you what the Day of Justice is? . Then again, what will convey to you what the Day of Justice is? . The Day when no soul will avail another soul anything; and the decision on that Day is Allahs. . THE DEFRAUDERS al-Mutaffifin In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . Woe to the defrauders. . Those who, when they take a measure from people, they take in full. . But when they measure or weigh to others, they cheat. . Do these not know that they will be resurrected? . For a Great Day? . The Day when mankind will stand before the Lord of the Worlds? . Not at all. The record of the wicked is in Sijjeen. . But how can you know what Sijjeen is? . A numerical book. . Woe on that Day to the deniers. . Those who deny the Day of Reckoning. . But none denies it except the sinful aggressor. . When Our revelations are recited to him, he says, Legends of the ancients. . Not at all. Their hearts have become corroded by what they used to earn. . Not at all. On that Day, they will be screened from their Lord. . Then they will roast in Hell. . Then it will be said, This is what you used to deny. . THE RUPTURE al-Inshiqaq . No indeed; the record of the righteous is in Elliyyeen. . But how can you know what Elliyyoon is? . A numerical book. . Witnessed by those brought near. . Indeed, the righteous will be amid bliss. .
