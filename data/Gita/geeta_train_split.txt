Bhagavad Gita

Introduction
YOU ARE about to have the profound pleasure of reading one
of the truly great books in the history of the world Not only
is it a spiritual monumentan essential scripture of Hinduism
recited daily for two millennia and to this very day whose
teachings have spread throughout Asia and around the globe
it is also a literary masterpiece the linchpin of a great epic of
war and peace honor and disgrace loyalty and betrayal It is a
book people everywhere in the world return to again and again
throughout their lives for insight into the nature of reality
For the Hindu philosophers the Bhagavad Gita was always
of great importance It is one of the three central texts of
Vedanta the other two being the Brahma Sutras and the
Upanishads From the ninth century CE onwards philosophers
such as Shankara Ramanuja Madhva and Nimbarka in the
Vedanta tradition and Abhinavagupta in the Shaiva tradition
wrote learned commentaries on the Gita It was also translated from Sanskrit into other Indian languages for example
Jnaneshvaras Marathi version in the thirteenth century As a
work of literature the epic was immensely important to the
cultural life of India and even beyond her shores notably in
Indonesia where parts were translated into Old Javanese
x INTRODUCTION
It was during the British Raj that the Gita first achieved
worldwide fame Many educated Indians were struggling to
defend Hinduism against the onslaught of western culture and
gradually the Gita was considered to embody the essential spirit
and deepest truths of Hinduism The Hindu reformer Ram
Mohun Roy referred to the Gita as the essence of all shastras
or the essence of all scriptures By 1912 C F Andrews could
claim that the Gita had become a common and wellread
scripture for the whole of educated India It also appealed to
another and very different group of people the Theosophists
It was the Theosophists who introduced the Gita to that most
famous of all modern Indians Mohandas K Gandhi
Since Gandhi was introduced to the Gita by the Theosophists he learned to read it in an allegorical way The mighty
battle was really a struggle for truthwhich he saw as another
word for Godto be sought through love and love ruled out
violence Ahimsa or nonviolence became the key to Gandhis
understanding of the Gita which he called his spiritual dictionary He was particularly fascinated by two words aparigraha nonpossession which suggested the renunciation of
money and property to avoid cramping the life of the spirit
and samabhava equability which asked him to transcend
pain or pleasure victory or defeat and to work without hope
of success or fear of failure The Gita became an inspiration to
Gandhi and millions of his followers a manual of devotion and
action in the modern world
The Gita also found a rapt audience in the West and a fascinating global crossfertilization followed It appealed both
to the German Romantics notably Schlegel Humboldt and
Goethe and to the American Transcendentalists a group in
New England who thought that insights which transcended
INTRODUCTION xi
logic and experience would reveal the deepest truths The Gita
was first translated into English in India in 1785 by Charles
Wilkins a merchant with the East India Company and his
translation made a deep impression on the Transcendentalists
leader Ralph Waldo Emerson Emersons poem Brahma
elegantly captures some of the essence of the Gita
If the red slayer think he slays
Or if the slain think he is slain
They know not well the subtle ways
I keep and pass and turn again
Far or forgot to me is near
Shadow and sunlight are the same
The vanished gods to me appear
and one to me are shame and fame
They reckon ill who leave me out
When me they fly I am the wings
I am the doubter and the doubt
And I the hymn the Brahmin sings
The strong gods pine for my abode
And pine in vain the sacred Seven
But thou meek lover of the good
Find me and turn thy back on heaven
The poem is based on a verse found in both the Gita and
the Katha Upanishad A century later another great poet
T S Eliot also had a lifelong interest in Indian philosophy
and incorporated it into his poetry as well Emerson made
xii INTRODUCTION
the Gita required reading for all those who were in rebellion
against evangelical Christianity Thus for the first time the
Gita became part of a counterculture
Another Transcendentalist Henry David Thoreau was a
tremendous enthusiast of the Gita but his interest was also a
practical one He incorporated a version of the Gitas teaching
on Karma Yoga into his own lifestyle and philosophy In 1849
he launched the idea of civil disobediencean idea that infl uenced Gandhis political thinking Thus an Indic idea passed
through a Western mind and returned transformed to India
Similarly the Theosophical Society was founded in New York
City moved its headquarters to India and was a catalyst in the
revival of Hinduism and Buddhism And of course Gandhis
ideas flowed back westward to inspire two other giants of the
twentieth century Martin Luther King Jr and Nelson Mandela
The current tidal wave of interest in the Gita in Yoga and
in things Indian began in the 1960s with the efflorescence
of another counterculture the paperback revolution in book
publishing the new farreaching curricula of a higher educational system undergoing explosive growth and the arrival
in the West of gurus such as Swami Vishnudevananda Swami
Satchidananda and A C Bhaktivedanta all following in the
footsteps of Swami Vivekananda
Today the Bhagavad Gita is firmly established around the
world as a true classic But not a dusty old classic It is astonishingly fresh and inspiring even to readers who do not share
the underlying assumptions of the text Knowledge and selfdiscipline are still virtues Selflessness is as sound today as
it was then Doing ones duty regardless of consequences is
needed now more than ever We may not share the Gitas views
on caste or endorse the social system it supports but we dont
INTRODUCTION xiii
have to We are free to choose and the Gita offers a number
of choices Its core of universal values and its poetic grandeur
make the Gita a living classic
I mentioned earlier that the Gita is the linchpin of a great
epic and that epic is the Mahabharata or Great Story of the
Bharatas With nearly one hundred thousand verses divided
into eighteen books it is one of the longest epic poems in the
worldfully seven times longer than the Iliad and the Odyssey
combined or three times longer than the Bible It is in fact a
whole library of stories that exerted a tremendous influence on
the people and literature of India
The central story of the Mahabharata is a conflict over succession to the throne of Hastinapura a kingdom just north
of modern Delhi that was the ancestral realm of a tribe most
commonly known as the Bharatas India was at that time
divided amongst many small and often warring kingdoms
The struggle is between two groups of cousins the Pandavas
or sons of Pandu and the Kauravas or descendants of Kuru
Because of his blindness Dhritarashtra the elder brother of
Pandu is passed over as king the throne going instead to Pandu
However Pandu renounces the throne and Dhritarashtra
assumes power after all The sons of PanduYudhishthira
Bhima Arjuna Nakula and Sahadevagrow up together
with their cousins the Kauravas Due to enmity and jealousy
the Pandavas are forced to leave the kingdom when their
father dies During their exile they jointly marry Draupadi
and befriend their cousin Krishna who from then on accompanies them They return and share sovereignty with the
Kauravas but have to withdraw to the forest for thirteen years
when Yudhishthira loses all his possessions in a game of dice
with Duryodhana the eldest of the Kauravas When they
xiv INTRODUCTION
return from the forest to demand their share of the kingdom
back Duryodhana refuses This means war Krishna acts as
counselor to the Pandavas The Gita is found right here with
the two armies facing each other and ready for battle The
battle rages for eighteen days and ends with the defeat of the
Kauravas All the Kauravas die only the five Pandava brothers
and Krishna survive The six set out for heaven together but
all die on the way except Yudhishthira who reaches the gates
of heaven accompanied only by a small dog who turns out to
be an incarnation of the god Dharma After tests of faithfulness and constancy Yudhishthira is reunited in heaven with his
brothers and Draupadi in eternal bliss
It is within this enormous epicthe sizable book you hold
in your hands is well less than one percent of the Mahabharata
that we find the Bhagavad Gita or the Song of the Lord most
commonly referred to simply as the Gita It is found in the sixth
book of the epic just before the great battle between the Pandavas
and the Kauravas The greatest hero of the Pandavas Arjuna
has pulled up his chariot in the middle of the battlefield between
the two opposing armies He is accompanied by Krishna who
acts as his charioteer In a fit of despondency Arjuna throws
down his bow and refuses to fight deploring the immorality of
the coming war It is a moment of supreme drama time stands
still the armies are frozen in place and God speaks
The situation is extremely grave A great kingdom is about
to selfdestruct in internecine warfare making a mockery of
dharma the eternal moral laws and customs that govern the
universe Arjunas objections are well founded He is the victim
of a moral paradox On the one hand he is facing persons who
according to dharma deserve his respect and veneration On
the other hand his duty as a warrior demands that he kill them
INTRODUCTION xv
Yet no fruits of victory would seem to justify such a heinous
crime It is seemingly a dilemma without solution It is this
state of moral confusion that the Gita sets out to mend
When Arjuna refuses to fight Krishna has no patience
with him Only when he realizes the extent of Arjunas despondency does Krishna change his attitude and start teaching
the mysteries of dharmic action in this world He introduces Arjuna to the structure of the universe the concepts
of prakriti primordial nature and the three gunas the properties that are active in prakriti Then he takes Arjuna on a
tour of philosophical ideas and ways of salvation He discusses
the nature of theory and action the importance of ritual the
ultimate principle Brahman all the while gradually disclosing
his own nature as the highest god This part of the Gita culminates in an overwhelming vision Krishna allows Arjuna to see
his supernal form the Vishvarupa which strikes terror into
Arjunas heart The rest of the Gita deepens and supplements
the ideas presented before the epiphanythe importance of
selfcontrol and faith of equanimity and unselfishness but
above all of bhakti or devotion Krishna explains to Arjuna
how he can obtain immortality by transcending the properties which qualify not only primordial matter but also human
character and behavior Krishna also emphasizes the importance of doing ones duty declaring that it is better to do ones
own duty without distinction than to do anothers duty well
In the end Arjuna is convinced He picks up his bow and is
ready to fight
Knowing a couple of things will make your reading easier
The first is that the Gita is a conversation within a conversation Dhritarashtra begins it by asking a question and that is
the last we hear out of him He is answered by Sanjaya who
xvi INTRODUCTION
relates what is happening on the battlefield It is actually more
dramatic and wondrous than the previous sentence indicates
Dhritarashtra is blind Vyasa his father offers to restore his
sight so he can follow the battle Dhritarashtra declines this
boon feeling that seeing the carnage of his kinsmen would be
more than he could bear So instead Vyasa bestows clairvoyance and clairaudience upon Sanjaya Dhritarashtras minister
and charioteer As they sit in their palace Sanjaya relates what
he sees and hears on the distant battlefield Sanjaya pops up
now and again throughout the book as he relates to Dhritarashtra the conversation between Krishna and Arjuna This
second conversation is a bit onesided as Krishna does almost
all of the talking Thus Sanjaya describes the situation Arjuna
asks the questions and Krishna gives the answers
The second thing to be aware of is the profusion of
nicknames also known as epithets Almost all other translations
either omit them or normalize them for simplicitys sake Thus
Hrishikesha Keshava Govinda and many other names will be
left out or just translated as Krishna and Son of Pritha Son of
Kunti Mightyarmed Prince Bharata and many other epithets
will be omitted or reduced to Arjuna To maintain fidelity to
the original I am retaining all of them They also make the
text more flavorful and interesting provide insight into Indian
culture and indeed into the story itself For example Krishna
uses epithets of Arjuna that remind him of his royal lineage his
prowess in battle and so on to ease his dejection They are also
meaningful to our Indian readers If you find them confusing
please turn to the back of the book where you will find a comprehensive glossary explaining all the names and nicknames
Many of these names are still in use so you may well find some
of your friends and acquaintances listed there
INTRODUCTION xvii
Unfortunately one thing I cannot do to make your reading
easier is completely explain everything in the Gita That would
be beyond the scope of an introduction or even an entire book
For devotees and scholars alike the Gitaand all the questions
it raisescan absorb a lifetime of study The YogaVidyacom
web site lists dozens of books for further reading I can
however alert you to one fact about the Gita that will save you
a lot of anguish and frustration It contradicts itself This was
recognized early on and was cited by Shankara as the reason for
writing his commentary
Many explanations have been put forward to explain how
theism asceticism dualism pantheism pragmatic materialism Yoga Vedanta and even Buddhism all got woven into the
text One is that at the time the Gita was written the various
systems of philosophy were not yet rigid and standardized nor
conceived of as being mutually exclusive Another is that it is a
work of mysticism and devotion and is not intended to be logical
or systematic Another is that the text has the practical aim of
salvation and is content to tolerantly lay out a variety of options
A variation on this view is that the options are graded according
to simplicity or diffi culty with the way of knowledge being the
most diffi cult and the way of devotion being the simplest and
most efficient Still another is to assign a hierarchy of truths
to the statements in the Gita so that some tell a simple truth
and others reveal a higher truth It should be noted that we still
live with intellectual inconsistencies and levels of truth even in
the modern world For instance we simultaneously believe in
and utilize the classical mechanics of Newton and the relativity theory of Einstein Both theories are true at the same time
but not on the same level The inconsistencies of the Gita may
xviii INTRODUCTION
have been as undisturbing to the ancients as the inconsistencies
in our own theories of reality are to us
Who wouldve written such a complicated book Indian
tradition holds that the entire Mahabharata was written by
Vyasa and many traditional pandits still hold this view Modern
scholarship has arrived at a more complex answer There is no
single author or single date of composition and it began as oral
poetry A reciter would have had to know the story but his
reputation depended upon his skill in bringing the traditional
material to life Then as now a firstclass narrator was much in
demand We know from other oralpoetry traditions that the
same bard would present the same story in different versions
longer or shorter as it suited the occasion Thus in its oral
form the epic had a reasonably fixed core but its performance
was highly flexible with additions embellishments and digressions made on the spot to please the audience In addition oral
poets had at their disposal a large number of formulaic expressions that could be easily fitted into the epics sixteensyllable
meter in which the length of only a few syllables was fixed The
original nucleus of the epic may have been the creation of a
single bard or possibly a small group of bards but it is now
irrecoverable It is likely to have been substantially shorter
than the Mahabharatas shortest recorded version of twentyfour thousand verses although we shouldnt underestimate the
ability of oral cultures to produce very long texts
An educated guess would suggest that the origin of the
Mahabharata lies sometime during the eighth or ninth centuries
BCE although some scholars consider the roots of the epic to be
much older Among the specialists there is now general agreement that the oldest portions of the epic that have been preserved
are not likely to be older than 400 BCE On the other end it is
INTRODUCTION xix
difficult to fix an upper limit for the Mahabharatas composition
The didactic portions of the twelfth book in particular seem to
have been added very late perhaps in the fourth century CE
Looking more specifically at the Gita most scholars think
the oldest parts may go back to the third century BCE whereas
the theistic portions may stem from the middle or end of the
second century BCE Chapters twelve through fi fteen may date
from the first century CE whereas chapter seventeen is possibly
even younger The Gita was likely composed somewhere in
northcentral India perhaps in modern Haryana or western
Uttar Pradesh These conclusions would probably hold good
whether we believe that the Gita was a work originally separate
from the Mahabharata as some claim or that it was originally
part of the great epic Even if the Gita was not originally a
single unit or part of the epic it has by now been handed down
and read that way for many centuries
We dont know when the Mahabharata was first written
down Possibly it was a gradual process where parts of the epic
were put into manuscripts whereas other parts were still transmitted orally Whenever the process started there were only two
possibilities in the north birch bark was used and in the south
palm leaves These are brittle materials and frequent recopying
was required if the text wasnt to be lost The earliest surviving
manuscript is from the ninth century CE An owner of a manuscript could do with it as he pleased and books consisting of
leaves bound together with string allow other leaves to be easily
inserted The quality of the copying varied with the scribe
a bad scribe might make errors and a better scribe might subsequently improve the text All these processes created a lack of
consistency so we should not be surprised at the great variety
amongst the different versions or recensions of the text
xx INTRODUCTION
The Gita first rolled off a printing press before there were
complete editions of the Mahabharata itself As noted earlier it
was translated into English for the first time in 1785 by Charles
Wilkins The first Sanskrit edition came out in 1806 under the
supervision of Sir William Jones In 1823 the German scholar
August Wilhelm von Schlegel produced a firstclass edition
of the Gita and added a Latin translation The first printed
edition of the Mahabharata was the socalled Calcutta edition
completed in 1839 which was based on the Bengali recension
of the text The next attempt was the Bombay edition largely
based on the recension in Devanagari script and completed in
1863 The Kumbhakonam edition of 1910 incorporated the
southern recension
This situation was clearly less than satisfactory so one of the
greatest scholarly undertakings of the twentieth century was
begun in 1919 at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute
in Poona now spelled Pune No less than ten distinguished
editors initially led by V S Sukthankar and a host of assistants labored for fortyseven years to produce the definitive
edition of the Mahabharata The objective was to reconstruct
the oldest possible form of the text on the basis of hundreds of
manuscripts collected from all over the Indian subcontinent
and Indonesia The resulting set of nineteen volumes containing thirteen thousand pages was completed in 1966 I am
very pleased that the Institute granted us permission to include
their definitive Sanskrit edition of the Gita in this book and
we have taken great pains to present it to you in the beautiful
Devanagari scriptan extremely rare event outside of India I
would also like to thank Dr John Smith who has made an electronic text of the Mahabharata available on the Internet
INTRODUCTION xxi
The situation regarding English translations today is also
less than satisfactoryin fact quite surprisingly so given
that the Gita has been translated into English literally hundreds of times over the last two centuries The publisher of
YogaVidyacom carefully examined more than a dozen of the
most highly regarded translations with an eye toward reissuing
the best one Instead he found them astonishingly deficient
Some stayed so close to the Indic syntax that they were unreadable in English Others strayed so far from the original text that
they were merely unreliable paraphrases Still others suffered
from ugly transliteration or amateur versification Some others
were distorted by the beliefs or egoism of the translator And
yet others were deformed by their publishers marketing
departments always on the lookout for new hooks and angles
So the publisher asked me to have a go at it and I have
tried my best to sidestep these shortcomings and avoid introducing new ones I made great efforts to produce a translation
that is both highly accurate and true to the original Sanskrit I
refrained from using verse since that would militate against the
objective of accuracy As previously mentioned unlike almost
all other translations all the names and epithets have been
retained If the phrasing in a particular sentence strikes you as
strained or odd more often than not it is from attempting to
stay true to the original I did not gloss over the inconsistencies and diffi culties in the Gita nor did I cover up uncomfortable topics such as sacrifices caste sexism and the morality
of war Although usually read as the story of a man seeking
insight and salvation the Gita can also be read as the story of
a man with a conscience being taught to forget it And when
questions arose I consulted both Shankaras and Ramanujas
commentaries At the same time I sweated over every word
xxii INTRODUCTION
phrase and punctuation mark to make the translation as clear
and smooth as possible using uptodate terminology and
international standard written English Finally I dispensed
with footnotes so that you could relish this great work of literature without interruptions Again consult the bibliography
online if you wish to delve deeper into the philosophical issues
in the Gita
Now for some specifics The Indic conceptual system is
very different from the Western system It is often wellnigh
impossible to find English terms that are semantically coextensive with the Indic terms All translations of Sanskrit philosophical terms are therefore approximations and many are
disputed Moreover the exact meaning of a word is also determined by the philosophical and religious context in which it is
used Although other translators have made other choices in
some instances I have chosen to translate jnana with knowledge
vijnana with discrimination and vidya with wisdom or science
depending upon context I have chosen to translate the term
guna with property which I believe gives a better meaning
than the oftenused quality or constituent Since sattva causes
illumination because of its purity I have chosen to translate the
term with clarity rather than purity or goodness Rajas often
translated as passion I have translated as agitation in order to
better bring out the physical aspect of the term As for tamas
I have chosen sluggishness again to emphasize the physical
aspect I have translated siddhas as perfected ones and karma
mostly as action However karma has become an English
loanword meaning consequence of action Where I found
this to be the meaning I have rendered karma as karma
I have chosen to keep the Indic term Brahman even though
it is not a normal loanword in English The reason is that we
INTRODUCTION xxiii
dont have any word that really comes close to Brahman The
German scholar Paul Hacker sees it as primeval matter but
this in my opinion brings it too close to prakriti which I have
translated as primordial nature Primeval energy may be better
but is not entirely satisfactory either the immovable pole star
for instance is identified with the unchanging Brahman In
the Vedas Brahman relates especially to the power inherent in
the mantras A later text the Hiranyakeshi Grihyasutra says it is
the navel of the universe and the navel of the pranas breaths
Generally Brahman stands for the Absolute the source of
everything and is sometimes understood as a nonconscious
principle and sometimes as a conscious one or God The term
quite simply can be interpreted many ways I have therefore
preferred to give this brief explanation of the term Brahman
rather than translate it Its adjectival form is Brahmic
The word Yoga in various forms occurs almost one
hundred and fi fty times in the Gita It is a complex term and
allows for a number of different interpretations all dependent
upon the context The basic meaning is yokeYoga is in fact
etymologically related to the English word yokebut through
various metaphorical processes the word came to cover a much
wider semantic field The Gita predates by a few centuries
classical Yoga as we know it today so in the Gita the word
Yoga most often means simply mental discipline or just discipline or training while a yogi is a master of such discipline It
also refers to more specific forms of discipline such as Karma
Yoga which I translated as the discipline of action and Bhakti
Yoga translated as the discipline of devotion and to creative
or magical power In the colophons Yoga means a reflection or
meditation upon a given subject
xxiv INTRODUCTION
In the end a translation is always an interpretation but
an interpretation is not always a translation The only way
to get a truly intimate understanding of a Sanskrit text is to
learn Sanskrit Just by the way although its concepts can be
slippery and elusive the vocabulary and grammar of the Gita
are actually quite straightforward If you were to learn Sanskrit
you could read the Gita in the original quite early in your
studies That is one very important reason why we included
the Sanskrit in this book
You may be interested to know that each chapter of the
Gita was originally untitled We have followed the traditional practice of pulling chapter titles from the colophons
those delightfully flowery sentences that bring each chapter
to a satisfying close Each and every chapter title could have
begun with The Yoga of but we omitted this phrase to avoid
excessive repetition and confusing constructions We also took
the opportunity to shorten and simplify the colophons which
can be very long and highly complex
Finally casting aside for a moment the historical conundrums the scholarly debates and the technical minutia just
know one thing You are about to read one of the worlds truly
great books It is essential reading for a nontrivial understanding of Hinduism of India and indeed of life itself The
Bhagavad Gita still speaks to people everywhereacross the
oceans across the millennia and across the boundaries of
language religion and culture

Chapter One
Arjunas Despair
  
    
Dhritarashtra said When my troops and the sons of Pandu
eager to fight were arrayed on the Kuru field the field of law
what did they do Sanjaya
  
Sanjaya said When Duryodhana the king saw the army of
the Pandu sons assembled he went to his teacher and spoke
these words
    
Look at this huge army of the Pandu sons teacher arrayed for
battle by the son of Drupada that brilliant student of yours
     

Here are the heroes the great archers the equals of Bhima
and Arjuna in battle Yuyudhana Virata and the great warrior
Drupada Dhrishtaketu Chekitana and the heroic king of
Kashi Purujit Kuntibhoja and Shaibya bull among men
Yudhamanyu the bold and the heroic Uttamaujas Saubhadra
and the sons of Drupadaall of them great warriors
      
But best of Brahmins hear about our superior men the
leaders of my army I will mention them by name

You yourself Bhishma Karna and Kripa victor in battle
Ashvatthaman Vikarna as well as the son of Somadatta and
many other heroes willing to sacrifice their lives for my sake
all battlehardened wielders of many kinds of weapons

That force protected by Bhima is not a match for us but this
force protected by Bhishma is a match for them
    

Indeed it is Bhishma you must all protect along all avenues of
approach as you man your respective positions
    

In order to encourage him grandfather the majestic Kuru
elder roared his lions roar and blew his conch 

Then all of a sudden the conches kettledrums cymbals big
drums and horns were sounded It was a tumultuous noise And standing on their great chariot yoked with white horses
Madhava and the son of Pandu blew their divine conches

Hrishikesha blew his Pancajanya Dhananjaya his Devadatta
and Wolf Belly of terrible deeds blew the great conch Paundra
    
King Yudhishthira the son of Kunti blew his Anantavijaya
Nakula and Sahadeva their Sughosha and Manipushpaka

The Kashi king the great archer and the great warrior
Shikhandi Dhrishtadyumna and Virata and the undefeated
Satyaki Drupada and the sons of Drupada All together
O Lord of the Earth as well as the mightyarmed Saubhadra
blew their concheseach and every one
     
This thundering sound rent the hearts of the sons of
Dhritarashtra resounding through earth and sky
ARJUNAS DESPAIR 5

Then the apebannered son of Pandu seeing the sons of
Dhritarashtra lined up lifted his bow as the clash of arms
began and spoke these words to Hrishikesha O Lord of the
Earth Achyuta station my chariot between the two armies
so that I may observe these men standing eager for battle
with whom I must fight in this strenuous engagement
    

I see these men who have assembled here ready to fight
wanting to please the evilminded son of Dhritarashtra
in battle

When Gudakesha had spoken to him thus O Bharata
Hrishikesha stationed their splendid chariot between the two
armies right in front of Bhishma Drona and all the kings
and said Son of Pritha behold these Kurus assembled


There the son of Pritha saw standing fathers and grandfathers
as well as teachers uncles brothers sons grandsons friends
fathersinlaw and even allies in both armies When the son
of Kunti had seen them all these relatives arrayed he was
overcome with the greatest compassion deeply saddened and
said this When I see my family willing and ready to fight
Krishna my limbs falter my mouth goes dry There is a
trembling in my body and my hairs bristle

Gandiva slips from my hand and as for my skin it burns
I cannot stand firm and my mind seems to whirl
     

I see inauspicious portents Keshava and I see nothing good
achieved by killing my family in battle
ARJUNAS DESPAIR 7

I dont desire victory Krishna nor a kingdom or pleasures
What use is a kingdom to me Govinda What is enjoyment
or life

For precisely those for whose sake we desire a kingdom
enjoyment and pleasures are standing in line to battle against
us giving up their lives and riches
     
 
Teachers fathers sons yes even grandfathers uncles
fathersinlaw grandsons brothersinlaw and other
kinsmenthese I dont want to kill even if they kill us
Madhusudana even for the kingdom of the three worlds
and even less for the earth
   
What joy would we gain Janardana by killing the sons of
Dhritarashtra Only evil would accrue to us by killing
these malefactors

Therefore we must not kill the sons of Dhritarashtra and our
kinsmen How could we become happy by killing our family

Even if they their minds seduced by greed do not see the
wickedness of destroying the family and the crime in
betraying their friends how could we fail to know that we
should turn away from this evil we who see the wickedness
of destroying the family Janardana
    
When the family is destroyed the eternal family laws are
lost and when the law is lost lawlessness overwhelms the
whole family
   

ARJUNAS DESPAIR 9
Because lawlessness prevails Krishna the women of the
family become corrupted When the women are corrupted
Son of Vrishni the classes get confused a confusion leading
to hell for family and family killers For their fathers fall
deprived of their offerings of rice balls and water
   
Because of these transgressions of the family killers which
cause confusion of the classes the eternal caste laws and
family laws are set aside
   
We have heard Janardana that a place in hell is guaranteed
for men who have set aside their family laws
      
Alas We have decided to do great evil because we are ready
to kill our family out of greed for the pleasures of a kingdom
   
If the sons of Dhritarashtra weapons in hand were to kill me
in battle unresisting and unarmed that would be better for me

With these words Arjuna let go of his bow and arrows in
the midst of battle and sank down in his chariot his mind
tormented by sorrow
Thus ends the fi rst chapter entitled The Reflection upon
Arjunas Despair in the instruction which teaches the sacred
knowledge given by the exalted Krishna in his conversation
with Arjuna the auspicious Bhagavad Gita which is in the
work of a hundred thousand verses the glorious Mahabharata

Chapter Two
Theory
  
  
Sanjaya said Thus overcome with compassion his eyes filled
with tears in despair Madhusudana spoke to him
 

The Lord said Why has this foul delusion come over you
in this critical hour Arjuna It is ignoble it doesnt lead to
heaven and it is disgraceful

Do not succumb to cowardice Son of Pritha This is
unworthy of you Shake off this petty faintness of heart
Stand up Scorcher of Enemies

Arjuna said How can I fi ght with arrows against Bhishma
and Drona in battle Madhusudana They are worthy of
homage Enemy Slayer
      
     
It is better to eat beggars food here in this world than to
kill teachers of great honor If I were to kill my teachers who
are greedy for wealth here I would enjoy pleasures smeared
with blood
          

Nor do we know what is better for us whether we win or lose
The sons of Dhritarashtra are arrayed before us If we kill
them we shall not wish to live
    

My deepest nature has been stricken by the error of compassion With a mind confused about the law I ask you what
would be best Tell me this for sure I am your student
Teach me as I seek refuge in you
 
For I see nothing that would dispel this sorrow of mine which
desiccates my senses even if on earth I obtained unrivaled
wealth a kingdom yes even sovereignty over the gods 
  
    
Sanjaya said O Scorcher of Enemies after Gudakesha said this
to Hrishikesha he added I will not fight and then fell silent
    
With a hint of derision O Bharata Hrishikesha spoke these
words to him as he sat despairing between the two armies
 

The Lord said You sorrow over men you should not be
sorry for yet you address issues of learning Wise men grieve
neither for the dead nor for the living
        

Never was there a time when I did not exist nor you nor these
lords of men and never shall any of us cease to exist hereafter
     

Just as the embodied self passes through childhood youth
and old age in this body in the same manner it will obtain
another body A wise man is not confused about this
   
Contacts with the elements Son of Kunti are the source of
cold heat pleasure and pain They come and go eternally
Endure them Bharata
      
The man whom they do not trouble O Bull Among Men the
wise man for whom pain and pleasure are the same He is fi t
for immortality
 
There is no becoming from the nonexistent nor any unbecoming from the existent The boundary between these two
has been perceived by those who see the basic principles
THEORY 15
      

Know that this on which all the world has been strung is
indestructible No one can bring about the destruction of this
imperishable being
     

It is these bodies of the embodied eternal imperishable
and unfathomable self which come to an end Therefore
fi ght Bharata

He who thinks the embodied self is a slayer and he who
imagines it is slainneither of these understand It does not
slay nor is it slain
          
It is never born and it never dies nor will it come to life again
when it has ceased to be It is unborn eternal constant and
ancient It is not slain when the body is slain
    
How does the man who knows this indestructible eternal
unborn and imperishable principle Son of Pritha have
anybody killed or kill anybody
Like a man who has cast off his old clothes puts on others
that are new thus the embodied self casts off old bodies and
moves on to others that are new
      
Weapons do not cut it fi re does not burn it water does not
wet it wind does not parch it
