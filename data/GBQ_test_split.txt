GITA:

Guru is the creator Brahma; Guru is the preserver Vishnu; Guru is the destroyer Maheshvara; Guru is verily the Supreme Absolute. To that Guru we prostrate. Dhyaanamoolam gurormoortih poojaamoolam guroh padam; Mantramoolam gurorvaakyam mokshamoolam guroh kripaa. The Gurus form is the root of meditation; the Gurus feet are the root of worship; the Gurus word is the root of Mantra; the Gurus Grace is the root of liberation. Prayer to Lord Krishna Krishnaaya vaasudevaaya devakeenandanaaya cha; Nandagopakumaaraaya govindaaya namo namah. I bow again and again to Lord Krishna, son of Vasudeva, the delighter of Devaki, the darling of Nandagopa, the protector of cows. O Krishna! Thou art my sweet companion now. Thou hast a soft corner for me in Thy heart. Teach me now the mysteries of Thy divine play and the secrets of Vedanta. Thou sayest in the Gita I am the author of Vedanta and the knower of the Vedas. Thou art my best teacher. Explain to me the intricate details of Vedanta. Give me easy lessons. Kindly explain; why did Sukadev, a Brahma Jnani who was always absorbed in Brahman, teach the Bhagavata to King Parikshit? What are the differences in the experiences of a Bhakta who enjoys union with God, of a Yogi who is established in the highest Superconscious State, and of a Jnani firmly established in the state of oneness or Brahman? What is the real difference between liberation while living and disembodied liberation, between the transcendent state and the state beyond it, between the perishable Person, the imperishable Person and the Supreme Person? Let me be frank with Thee, O Krishna, because Thou art the indweller of my heart, the witness of my mind, and the Lord of my life-breath! I cannot hide anything from Thee, because Thou directly witnesseth all the thoughts that emanate from my mind. I have no fear of Thee. Thou art my friend now. Treat me like Arjuna. I shall sing and dance. You can play on the flute. Let us eat sugar-candy and butter together. Let us sing. Teach me the Gita. Let me hear it directly from Thy lips once more. O Thou invisible One! O adorable and Supreme One! Thou penetratest and permeatest this vast universe from the unlimited space down to the tiny blade of grass at my feet. Thou art the basis of all names and forms. Thou art the apple of my eye, the divine love of my heart, the life of my life, the very soul of my soul, the illuminator of my intellect and senses, the sweet mystic music of my heart, and the substance of my physical, mental and causal bodies. I recognise Thee alone as the mighty ruler of this universe and the inner controller of my three bodies. I prostrate again and again before Thee, my Lord. Thou art my sole refuge. I trust Thee alone, O ocean of mercy and love! Elevate, enlighten, guide and protect me. Remove the obstacles on my spiritual path. Remove the veil of ignorance. O Thou supreme world-teacher! I cannot bear any longer, even for a second, the miseries of this physical body, this life and this worldly existence. Meet me quickly, O Prabhu! I am pining, I am melting. Listen, listen, listen to my fervent, innermost prayer. Do not be cruel, my Lord. Thou art the friend of the afflicted. Thou art one who raises the downtrodden. Thou art the purifier of the fallen. O magnificent Lord of love and compassion! O fountain-head of bliss and knowledge! Thou art the eye of our eye, the ear of our ear, the breath of our breath, the mind of our mind, the soul of our soul. Thou art the unseen seer, the unthought thinker, the unheard hearer, the unknown knower. Pray, deliver us from temptation. Give us light, knowledge and purity. O Lord of my breath! O all-pervading Lord of the universe, accept my humble prayer! Guide me. Lift me from the mire of worldliness. Enlighten me. Protect me. Thee alone I adore; Thee alone I worship; on Thee alone I meditate in Thee alone I take sole refuge. Gita Mahatmya GLORY OF THE GITA To be read at the end of the days Gita study Sri Ganeshaaya Namah! Gopaalakrishnaaya Namah! Dharovaacha: Bhagavan parameshaana bhaktiravyabhichaarinee; Praarabdham bhujyamaanasya katham bhavati he prabho. The Earth said: . O Bhagavan, the Supreme Lord! How can unflinching devotion arise in him who is immersed in his Prarabdha Karmas worldly life, O Lord? Sri Vishnuruvaacha: Praarabdham bhujyamaano hi geetaabhyaasaratah sadaa; Sa muktah sa sukhee loke karmanaa nopalipyate. Lord Vishnu said: . Though engaged in the performance of worldly duties, one who is regular in the study of the Gita becomes free. He is the happy man in this world. He is not bound by Karma. Mahaapaapaadipaapaani geetaadhyaanam karoti chet; Kwachit sparsham na kurvanti nalineedalam ambuvat. . Just as the water stains not the lotus leaf, even so sins do not taint him who is regular in the recitation of the Gita. Geetaayaah pustakam yatra yatra paathah pravartate; Tatra sarvaani teerthaani prayaagaadeeni tatra vai. . All the sacred centres of pilgrimage, like Prayag and other places, dwell in that place where the Gita is kept, and where the Gita is read. Sarve devaashcha rishayo yoginahpannagaashcha ye; Gopaalaa gopikaa vaapi naaradoddhava paarshadaih. . All the gods, sages, Yogins, divine serpents, Gopalas, Gopikas friends and devotees of Lord Krishna, Narada, Uddhava and others dwell here. Sahaayo jaayate sheeghram yatra geetaa pravartate; Yatra geetaavichaarashcha pathanam paathanam shrutam; Tatraaham nishchitam prithvi nivasaami sadaiva hi. . Help comes quickly where the Gita is recited and, O Earth, I ever dwell where it is read, heard, taught and contemplated upon! Geetaashrayeham tishthaami geetaa me chottamam griham; Geetaajnaanam upaashritya treen Uokaan paalayaamyaham. . I take refuge in the Gita, and the Gita is My best abode. I protect the three worlds with the knowledge of the Gita. Geetaa me paramaa vidyaa brahmaroopaa na samshayah; Ardhamaatraaksharaa nityaa swaanirvaachyapadaatmikaa. . The Gita is My highest science, which is doubtless of the form of Brahman, the Eternal, the Ardhamatra of the Pranava Om, the ineffable splendour of the Self. Chidaanandena krishnena proktaa swamukhatorjuna; Vedatrayee paraanandaa tatwaarthajnaanasamyutaa. . It was spoken by the blessed Lord Krishna, the all-knowing, through His own mouth, to Arjuna. It contains the essence of the Vedasthe knowledge of the Reality. It is full of supreme bliss. COMMENTARY: The Gita contains the cream of the Vedas and Upanishads. Hence it is a universal scripture suited for people of all temperaments and for all ages. Yoashtaadasha japen nityam naro nishchalamaanasah; Jnaanasiddhim sa labhate tato yaati param padam. . He who recites the eighteen chapters of the Bhagavad Gita daily, with a pure and unshaken mind, attains perfection in knowledge, and reaches the highest state or supreme goal. Paatheasamarthah sampoornam tatordham paathamaacharet; Tadaa godaanajam punyam labhate naatra samshayah. . If a complete reading is not possible, even if only half is read, he attains the benefit of giving a cow as a gift. There is no doubt about this. Tribhaagam pathamaanastu gangaasnaanaphalam labhet; Shadamsham japamaanastu somayaagaphalam labhet. . He who recites one-third part of it achieves the merit of a bath in the sacred river Ganges; and who recites one-sixth of it attains the merit of performing a Soma sacrifice a kind of ritual. Ekaadhyaayam tu yo nityam pathate bhaktisamyutah; Rudralokam avaapnoti gano bhootwaa vasecchiram. . That person who reads one discourse with supreme faith and devotion attains to the world of Rudra and, having become a Gana an attendant of Lord Shiva, lives there for many years. Adhyaayam shlokapaadam vaa nityam yah pathate narah; Sa yaati narataam yaavanmanwantaram vasundhare. . If one reads a discourse or even a part of a verse daily he, O Earth, retains a human body till the end of a Manvantara Mahayugas or ,, years. Geetaayaah shloka dashakam sapta pancha chatushtayam; Dwautreenekam tadardhamvaa shlokaanaam yah pathennarah. Chandralokam avaapnoti varshaanaam ayutam dhruvam; Geetaapaathasamaayukto mrito maanushataam vrajet. -. He who repeats ten, seven, five, four, three, two verses or even one or half of it, attains the region of the moon and lives there for , years. Accustomed to the daily study of the Gita, a dying man comes back to life again as a human being. Geetaabhyaasam punah kritwaa labhate muktim uttamaam; Geetetyucchaarasamyukto mriyamaano gatim labhet. . By repeated study of the Gita, he attains liberation. Uttering the word Gita at the time of death, a person attains liberation. Geetaarthashravanaasakto mahaapaapayutopi vaa; Vaikuntham samavaapnoti vishnunaa saha modate. . Though full of sins, one who is ever intent on hearing the meaning of the Gita, goes to the kingdom of God and rejoices with Lord Vishnu. Geetaartham dhyaayate nityam kritwaa karmaani bhoorishah; Jeevanmuktah sa vijneyo dehaante paramam padam. . He who meditates on the meaning of the Gita, having performed many virtuous actions, attains the supreme goal after death. Such an individual should be considered a true Jivanmukta. COMMENTARY: A Jivanmukta is one who has attained liberation while living. Geetaam aashritya bahavo bhoobhujo janakaadayah; Nirdhootakalmashaa loke geetaa yaataah param padam. . In this world, taking refuge in the Gita, many kings like Janaka and others reached the highest state or goal, purified of all sins. Geetaayaah pathanam kritwaa maahaatmyam naiva yah pathet; Vrithaa paatho bhavet tasya shrama eva hyudaahritah. . He who fails to read this Glory of the Gita after having read the Gita, loses the benefit thereby, and the effort alone remains. COMMENTARY: This is to test and confirm the faith of the reader in the Bhagavad Gita, which is not a mere philosophical book but the word of God and should therefore be studied with great faith and devotion. The Gita Mahatmya generates this devotion in ones heart. Etanmaahaatmyasamyuktam geetaabhyaasam karoti yah; Sa tatphalamavaapnoti durlabhaam gatim aapnuyaat. . One who studies the Gita, together with this Glory of the Gita, attains the fruits mentioned above, and reaches the state which is otherwise very difficult to be attained. Suta Uvaacha: Maahaatmyam etad geetaayaah mayaa proktam sanaatanam; Geetaante cha pathedyastu yaduktam tatphalam labhet. Suta said: . This greatness or Glory of the Gita, which is eternal, as narrated by me, should be read at the end of the study of the Gita, and the fruits mentioned therein will be obtained. Iti srivaraahapuraane srigeetaamaahaatmyam sampoornam. Thus ends the Glory of the Gita contained in the Varaha Purana. Om Shanti, Shanti, Shanti! Gita Dhyanam MEDITATION ON THE GITA Om paarthaaya pratibodhitaam bhagavataa naaraayanenaswayam, Vyaasena grathitaam puraanamuninaa madhye mahaabhaaratam; Advaitaamritavarshineem bhagavateem ashtaadashaa dhyaayineem, Amba twaam anusandadhaami bhagavadgeete bhavadweshineem. . Om. O Bhagavad Gita, with which Partha was illumined by Lord Narayana Himself, and which was composed within the Mahabharata by the ancient sage, Vyasa, O Divine Mother, the destroyer of rebirth, the showerer of the nectar of Advaita, and consisting of eighteen discoursesupon Thee, O Gita, O affectionate Mother, I meditate! Namostu te vyaasa vishaalabuddhe phullaaravindaayatapatranetra; Yena twayaa bhaaratatailapoornah prajwaalito jnaanamayah pradeepah. . Salutations unto thee, O Vyasa, of broad intellect and with eyes like the petals of a full-blown lotus, by whom the lamp of knowledge, filled with the oil of the Mahabharata, has been lighted! Prapannapaarijaataaya totravetraikapaanaye; Jnaanamudraaya krishnaaya geetaamritaduhe namah. . Salutations to Lord Krishna, the Parijata or the Kalpataru or the bestower of all desires for those who take refuge in Him, the holder of the whip in one hand, the holder of the symbol of divine knowledge and the milker of the divine nectar of the Bhagavad Gita! Sarvopanishado gaavo dogdhaa gopaalanandanah; Paartho vatsah sudheer bhoktaa dugdham geetaamritam mahat. . All the Upanishads are the cows; the milker is Krishna; the cowherd boy, Partha Arjuna, is the calf; men of purified intellect are the drinkers; the milk is the great nectar of the Gita. Vasudevasutam devam kamsachaanooramardanam; Devakeeparamaanandam krishnam vande jagadgurum. . I salute Sri Krishna, the world-teacher, son of Vasudeva, the destroyer of Kamsa and Chanura, the supreme bliss of Devaki! Bheeshmadronatataa jayadrathajalaa gaandhaaraneelotpalaa; Shalyagraahavatee kripena vahanee karnena velaakulaa; Ashwatthaama-vikarna-ghora-makaraa duryodhanaavartinee; Sotteernaa khalu paandavai rananadee kaivartakah keshavah. . With Kesava as the helmsman, verily was crossed by the Pandavas the battle-river, whose banks were Bhishma and Drona, whose water was Jayadratha, whose blue lotus was the king of Gandhara, whose crocodile was Salya, whose current was Kripa, whose billow was Karna, whose terrible alligators were Vikarna and Asvatthama, whose whirlpool was Duryodhana. Paaraasharya vachah sarojamamalam geetaarthagandhotkatam; Naanaakhyaanakakesaram harikathaa sambodhanaabodhitam; Loke sajjana shatpadairaharahah pepeeyamaanam mudaa; Bhooyaadbhaaratapankajam kalimala pradhwamsinah shreyase. . May this lotus of the Mahabharata, born in the lake of the words of Vyasa, sweet with the fragrance of the meaning of the Gita, with many stories as its stamens, fully opened by the discourses of Hari, the destroyer of the sins of Kali, and drunk joyously by the bees of good men in the world, become day by day the bestower of good to us! Mookam karoti vaachaalam pangum langhayate girim; Yatkripaa tamaham vande paramaanandamaadhavam. . I salute that Madhava, the source of supreme bliss, whose Grace makes the dumb eloquent and the cripple cross mountains! Yam brahmaa varunendrarudramarutah stunwanti divyaih stavaih, Vedaih saangapadakramopanishadair gaayanti yam saamagaah, Dhyaanaavasthitatadgatena manasaa pashyanti yam yogino, Yasyaantam na viduh suraasuraganaa devaaya tasmai namah. . Salutations to that God whom Brahma, Indra, Varuna, Rudra and the Maruts praise with divine hymns, of whom the Sama-chanters sing by the Vedas and their Angas in the Pada and Krama methods, and by the Upanishads; whom the Yogis see with their minds absorbed in Him through meditation, and whose ends the hosts of Devas and Asuras know not! I The Yoga of the Despondency of Arjuna Summary of First Discourse The great Mahabharata war between the Pandavas and the Kauravas took place on the holy plain of Kurukshetra. After the failure of Lord Krishnas peace mission, when He Himself went to Hastinapura as the emissary of the Pandavas, there was no other alternative for the Pandavas but to engage in war for their rightful share of the kingdom. All the famous warriors from both sides had assembled on the battlefield. Tents and wagons, weapons and machines, chariots and animals covered the vast plain. Lord Krishna arrived on the scene in a magnificent chariot yoked by white horses. He was to act as the charioteer of Arjuna, one of the Pandava princes. The din of hundreds of conches, blaring forth suddenly, announced the commencement of the battle. Arjuna blew his conch Devadatta, while Bhima, his brother, sounded the Paundra. All the other great warriors blew their respective conches. As the two armies were arrayed, ready for battle, Arjuna requested Krishna to place his chariot between them so that he might survey his opponents. He was bewildered by the scene before him, for he beheld on both sides, fathers and grandfathers, teachers and uncles, fathers-in-law, grandsons, relatives and comrades. Confusion reigned in Arjunas mind. Should he participate in this terrible carnage? Was it proper to destroy ones relatives for the sake of a kingdom and some pleasures? Would it not be much better for him to surrender everything in favour of his enemies and retire in peace? As these thoughts rushed into his mind, a feeling of despondency overtook Arjuna. He had no enthusiasm to engage in this battle. Letting his bow slip from his hands, Arjuna could do nothing but turn to Lord Krishna for guidance and enlightenment. Dhritaraashtra Uvaacha: Dharmakshetre kurukshetre samavetaa yuyutsavah; Maamakaah paandavaashchaiva kim akurvata sanjaya. Dhritarashtra said: . What did the sons of Pandu and also my people do when they had assembled together, eager for battle on the holy plain of Kurukshetra, O Sanjaya? Sanjaya Uvaacha: Drishtwaa tu paandavaaneekam vyudham duryodhanastadaa; Aachaaryam upasamgamya raajaa vachanam abraveet. Sanjaya said: . Having seen the army of the Pandavas drawn up in battle array, King Duryodhana then approached his teacher Drona and spoke these words: Pashyaitaam paanduputraanaam aachaarya mahateem chamoom; Vyoodhaam drupadaputrena tava shishyena dheemataa. . Behold, O Teacher, this mighty army of the sons of Pandu, arrayed by the son of Drupada, thy wise disciple! Atra shooraa maheshwaasaa bheemaarjunasamaa yudhi; Yuyudhaano viraatashcha drupadashcha mahaarathah. . Here are heroes, mighty archers, equal in battle to Bhima and Arjuna, Yuyudhana, Virata and Drupada, of the great car mighty warriors, Dhrishtaketush chekitaanah kaashiraajashcha veeryavaan; Purujit kuntibhojashcha shaibyashcha narapungavah. . Drishtaketu, Chekitana and the valiant king of Kasi, Purujit, and Kuntibhoja and Saibya, the best of men, Yudhaamanyushcha vikraanta uttamaujaashcha veeryavaan; Saubhadro draupadeyaashcha sarva eva mahaarathaah. . The strong Yudhamanyu and the brave Uttamaujas, the son of Subhadra Abhimanyu, the son of Arjuna, and the sons of Draupadi, all of great chariots great heroes. Asmaakam tu vishishtaa ye taan nibodha dwijottama; Naayakaah mama sainyasya samjnaartham taan braveemi te. . Know also, O best among the twice-born, the names of those who are the most distinguished amongst ourselves, the leaders of my army! These I name to thee for thy information. Bhavaan bheeshmashcha karnashcha kripashcha samitinjayah; Ashwatthaamaa vikarnashcha saumadattis tathaiva cha. . Thyself and Bhishma, and Karna and Kripa, the victorious in war; Asvatthama, Vikarna, and Jayadratha, the son of Somadatta. Anye cha bahavah shooraa madarthe tyaktajeevitaah; Naanaashastrapraharanaah sarve yuddhavishaaradaah. . And also many other heroes who have given up their lives for my sake, armed with various weapons and missiles, all well skilled in battle. Aparyaaptam tad asmaakam balam bheeshmaabhirakshitam; Paryaaptam twidam eteshaam balam bheemaabhirakshitam. . This army of ours marshalled by Bhishma is insufficient, whereas their army, marshalled by Bhima, is sufficient. Ayaneshu cha sarveshu yathaabhaagam avasthitaah; Bheeshmam evaabhirakshantu bhavantah sarva eva hi. . Therefore, do ye all, stationed in your respective positions in the several divisions of the army, protect Bhishma alone. Tasya sanjanayan harsham kuruvriddhah pitaamahah; Simhanaadam vinadyocchaih shankham dadhmau prataapavaan. . His glorious grandsire Bhishma, the eldest of the Kauravas, in order to cheer Duryodhana, now roared like a lion and blew his conch. Tatah shankhaashcha bheryashcha panavaanakagomukhaah; Sahasaivaabhyahanyanta sa shabdastumulobhavat. . Then following Bhishma, conches and kettle-drums, tabors, drums and cow-horns blared forth quite suddenly from the side of the Kauravas; and the sound was tremendous. Tatah shvetair hayair yukte mahati syandane sthitau; Maadhavah paandavashchaiva divyau shankhau pradadhmatuh. . Then also, Madhava Krishna, and the son of Pandu Arjuna, seated in their magnificent chariot yoked with white horses, blew their divine conches. Paanchajanyam hrisheekesho devadattam dhananjayah; Paundram dadhmau mahaashankham bheemakarmaa vrikodarah. . Hrishikesa blew the Panchajanya and Arjuna blew the Devadatta, and Bhima, the doer of terrible deeds, blew the great conch, Paundra. Anantavijayam raajaa kunteeputro yudhishthirah; Nakulah sahadevashcha sughoshamanipushpakau. . Yudhisthira, the son of Kunti, blew the Anantavijaya; and Sahadeva and Nakula blew the Manipushpaka and Sughosha conches. Kaashyashcha parameshwaasah shikhandee cha mahaarathah; Dhrishtadyumno viraatashcha saatyakishchaaparaajitah. . The king of Kasi, an excellent archer, Sikhandi, the mighty car-warrior, Dhristadyumna and Virata and Satyaki, the unconquered, Drupado draupadeyaashcha sarvashah prithiveepate; Saubhadrashcha mahaabaahuh shankhaan dadhmuh prithak prithak. . Drupada and the sons of Draupadi, O Lord of the Earth, and the son of Subhadra, the mighty-armed, all blew their respective conches! Sa ghosho dhaartaraashtraanaam hridayaani vyadaarayat; Nabhashcha prithiveem chaiva tumulo vyanunaadayan. . The tumultuous sound rent the hearts of Dhritarashtras party, making both heaven and earth resound. Atha vyavasthitaan drishtwaa dhaartaraashtraan kapidhwajah; Pravritte shastrasampaate dhanurudyamya paandavah. Hrisheekesham tadaa vaakyamidamaaha maheepate; . Then, seeing all the people of Dhritarashtras party standing arrayed and the discharge of weapons about to begin, Arjuna, the son of Pandu, whose ensign was that of a monkey, took up his bow and said the following to Krishna, O Lord of the Earth! Arjuna Uvaacha: Senayor ubhayormadhye ratham sthaapaya mechyuta. Yaavad etaan nireeksheham yoddhukaamaan avasthitaan; Kair mayaa saha yoddhavyam asmin ranasamudyame. Arjuna said: -. In the middle of the two armies, place my chariot, O Krishna, so that I may behold those who stand here, desirous to fight, and know with whom I must fight when the battle begins. Yotsyamaanaan aveksheham ya etetra samaagataah; Dhaartaraashtrasya durbuddher yuddhe priyachikeershavah. . For I desire to observe those who are assembled here to fight, wishing to please in battle Duryodhana, the evil-minded. Sanjaya Uvaacha: Evamukto hrisheekesho gudaakeshena bhaarata; Senayor ubhayormadhye sthaapayitwaa rathottamam. Sanjaya said: . Being thus addressed by Arjuna, Lord Krishna, having stationed that best of chariots, O Dhritarashtra, in the midst of the two armies, Bheeshmadronapramukhatah sarveshaam cha maheekshitaam; Uvaacha paartha pashyaitaan samavetaan kuroon iti. . In front of Bhishma and Drona and all the rulers of the earth, said: O Arjuna, behold now all these Kurus gathered together! Tatraapashyat sthitaan paarthah pitrin atha pitaamahaan; Aachaaryaan maatulaan bhraatrun putraan pautraan sakheemstathaa. . Then Arjuna beheld there stationed, grandfathers and fathers, teachers, maternal uncles, brothers, sons, grandsons and friends, too. Shvashuraan suhridashchaiva senayorubhayorapi; Taan sameekshya sa kaunteyah sarvaan bandhoon avasthitaan. Kripayaa parayaavishto visheedannidam abraveet; . He saw fathers-in-law and friends also in both armies. The son of KuntiArjunaseeing all these kinsmen standing arrayed, spoke thus sorrowfully, filled with deep pity. Arjuna Uvaacha: Drishtwemam swajanam krishna yuyutsum samupasthitam. Arjuna said: . Seeing these, my kinsmen, O Krishna, arrayed, eager to fight, Seedanti mama gaatraani mukham cha parishushyati; Vepathushcha shareere me romaharshashcha jaayate. . My limbs fail and my mouth is parched up, my body quivers and my hairs stand on end! Gaandeevam sramsate hastaat twak chaiva paridahyate; Na cha shaknomyavasthaatum bhramateeva cha me manah. . The bow Gandiva slips from my hand and my skin burns all over; I am unable even to stand, my mind is reeling, as it were. Nimittaani cha pashyaami vipareetaani keshava; Na cha shreyonupashyaami hatwaa swajanam aahave. . And I see adverse omens, O Kesava! I do not see any good in killing my kinsmen in battle. Na kaangkshe vijayam krishna na cha raajyam sukhaani cha; Kim no raajyena govinda kim bhogair jeevitena vaa. . For I desire neither victory, O Krishna, nor pleasures nor kingdoms! Of what avail is a dominion to us, O Krishna, or pleasures or even life? Yeshaam arthe kaangkshitam no raajyam bhogaah sukhaani cha; Ta imevasthitaa yuddhe praanaamstyaktwaa dhanaani cha. . Those for whose sake we desire kingdoms, enjoyments and pleasures, stand here in battle, having renounced life and wealth. Aachaaryaah pitarah putraastathaiva cha pitaamahaah; Maatulaah shwashuraah pautraah shyaalaah sambandhinas tathaa. . Teachers, fathers, sons and also grandfathers, grandsons, fathers-in-law, maternal uncles, brothers-in-law and relatives, Etaan na hantum icchaami ghnatopi madhusoodana; Api trailokya raajyasya hetoh kim nu maheekrite. . These I do not wish to kill, though they kill me, O Krishna, even for the sake of dominion over the three worlds, leave alone killing them for the sake of the earth! Nihatya dhaartaraashtraan nah kaa preetih syaaj janaardana; Paapam evaashrayed asmaan hatwaitaan aatataayinah. . By killing these sons of Dhritarashtra, what pleasure can be ours, O Janardana? Only sin will accrue by killing these felons. Tasmaan naarhaa vayam hantum dhaartaraashtraan swabaandhavaan; Swajanam hi katham hatwaa sukhinah syaama maadhava. . Therefore, we should not kill the sons of Dhritarashtra, our relatives; for, how can we be happy by killing our own people, O Madhava Krishna? Yadyapyete na pashyanti lobhopahatachetasah; Kulakshayakritam dosham mitradrohe cha paatakam. . Though they, with intelligence overpowered by greed, see no evil in the destruction of families, and no sin in hostility to friends, Katham na jneyam asmaabhih paapaad asmaan nivartitum; Kulakshayakritam dosham prapashyadbhir janaardana. . Why should not we, who clearly see evil in the destruction of a family, learn to turn away from this sin, O Janardana Krishna? COMMENTARY: Ignorance of the law is no excuse and wanton sinful conduct is a crime unworthy of knowledgeable people. Kulakshaye pranashyanti kuladharmaah sanaatanaah; Dharme nashte kulam kritsnam adharmobhibhavatyuta. . In the destruction of a family, the immemorial religious rites of that family perish; on the destruction of spirituality, impiety overcomes the whole family. COMMENTARY: Dharma pertains to the duties and ceremonies practised by the family in accordance with scriptural injunctions. Adharmaabhibhavaat krishna pradushyanti kulastriyah; Streeshu dushtaasu vaarshneya jaayate varnasankarah. . By prevalence of impiety, O Krishna, the women of the family become corrupt and, women becoming corrupted, O Varsneya descendant of Vrishni, there arises intermingling of castes! Sankaro narakaayaiva kulaghnaanaam kulasya cha; Patanti pitaro hyeshaam luptapindodakakriyaah. . Confusion of castes leads to hell the slayers of the family, for their forefathers fall, deprived of the offerings of rice-ball and water. Doshair etaih kulaghnaanaam varnasankarakaarakaih; Utsaadyante jaatidharmaah kuladharmaashcha shaashwataah. . By these evil deeds of the destroyers of the family, which cause confusion of castes, the eternal religious rites of the caste and the family are destroyed. Utsannakuladharmaanaam manushyaanaam janaardana; Narakeniyatam vaaso bhavateetyanushushruma. . We have heard, O Janardana, that inevitable is the dwelling for an unknown period in hell for those men in whose families the religious practices have been destroyed! Aho bata mahat paapam kartum vyavasitaa vayam; Yadraajya sukhalobhena hantum swajanam udyataah. . Alas! We are involved in a great sin in that we are prepared to kill our kinsmen through greed for the pleasures of a kingdom. Yadi maam aprateekaaram ashastram shastrapaanayah; Dhaartaraashtraa rane hanyus tanme kshemataram bhavet. . If the sons of Dhritarashtra, with weapons in hand, should slay me in battle, unresisting and unarmed, that would be better for me. Sanjaya Uvaacha: Evamuktwaarjunah sankhye rathopastha upaavishat; Visrijya sasharam chaapam shokasamvignamaanasah. Sanjaya said: . Having thus spoken in the midst of the battlefield, Arjuna, casting away his bow and arrow, sat down on the seat of the chariot with his mind overwhelmed with sorrow. Hari Om Tat Sat Iti Srimad Bhagavadgeetaasoopanishatsu Brahmavidyaayaam Yogashaastre Sri Krishnaarjunasamvaade Arjunavishaadayogo Naama Prathamodhyaayah. Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita, the science of the Eternal, the scripture of Yoga, the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna, ends the first discourse entitled: The Yoga Of the Despondency of Arjuna II Sankhya Yoga Summary of Second Discourse Sanjaya explains the condition of Arjuna, who was agitated due to attachment and fear. Lord Krishna rebukes him for his dejection, which was due to Moha or attachment, and exhorts him to fight. After failing to convince Sri Krishna through his seemingly wise thoughts, Arjuna realises his helplessness and surrenders himself completely to the Lord, seeking His guidance to get over the conflict of his mind. The Lord takes pity on him and proceeds to enlighten him by various means. He explains to Arjuna the imperishable nature of the Atman, for which there is no past, present and future. The Atman never dies, therefore Arjuna should not grieve. As It transcends the five elements, namely, earth, water, fire, air and ether, It cannot be cut, burnt or dried. It is unchanging and eternal. Everyone experiences conditions like pleasure and pain, heat and cold, due to contact of objects with the senses. The senses carry the sensations through the nerves to the mind. One should be able to withdraw the senses from objects, like the tortoise which withdraws all its limbs within. Krishna asserts that only one who has the capacity to be balanced in pleasure and pain alike is fit for immortality. Krishna goes on to tell Arjuna that if he refuses to fight and flees from the battle, people will be justified in condemning such action as unworthy of a warrior. Having taught Arjuna the immortal nature of the Atman, Lord Krishna turns to the performance of action without expectation of fruit. A man should not concern himself about the fruit of the action, like gain and loss, victory and defeat. These are in the hands of the Lord. He should perform all action with a balanced mind, calmly enduring the pairs of opposites like heat and cold, pleasure and pain, that inevitably manifest during action. Krishna advises Arjuna to fight, free from desire for acquisition of kingdom or preservation of it. Arjuna is eager to know the characteristics of a man who has a stable mind. Such a person, Krishna tells him, will have no desires at all. Since he is content within, having realised the Self, he is entirely free from desires. The consciousness of the Atman and abandonment of desires are simultaneous experiences. The various qualities of a Sthitaprajna a stable-minded person are described by the Lord. He will not be affected by adversity and will have no fear or anger. He will take things as they come, and will not have any likes and dislikes. He will neither hug the world nor hate it. The man of stable mind will have perfect control of the senses. The senses are powerful and draw the mind outwards. One should therefore turn ones gaze within and realise God who resides in the heart. The Yogi, having achieved a stable mind, remains steadfast even though all sense-objects come to him. He is unmoved and lives a life of eternal peace. Krishna concludes that the eternal Brahmic state frees one from delusion forever. Even at the end of life, when one departs from this body, one does not lose consciousness of ones identity with Brahman. Sanjaya Uvaacha: Tam tathaa kripayaavishtam ashrupoornaakulekshanam; Visheedantam idam vaakyam uvaacha madhusoodanah. Sanjaya said: . To him who was thus overcome with pity and who was despondent, with eyes full of tears and agitated, Krishna or Madhusudana the destroyer of Madhu, spoke these words. Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha: Kutastwaa kashmalam idam vishame samupasthitam; Anaaryajushtam aswargyam akeertikaram arjuna. The Blessed Lord said: . Whence is this perilous strait come upon thee, this dejection which is unworthy of thee, disgraceful, and which will close the gates of heaven upon thee, O Arjuna? Klaibyam maa sma gamah paartha naitat twayyupapadyate; Kshudram hridaya daurbalyam tyaktwottishtha parantapa. . Yield not to impotence, O Arjuna, son of Pritha! It does not befit thee. Cast off this mean weakness of the heart. Stand up, O scorcher of foes! Arjuna Uvaacha: Katham bheeshmamaham sankhye dronam cha madhusoodana; Ishubhih pratiyotsyaami poojaarhaavarisoodana. Arjuna said: . How, O Madhusudana, shall I fight in battle with arrows against Bhishma and Drona, who are fit to be worshipped, O destroyer of enemies? Guroon ahatwaa hi mahaanubhaavaan Shreyo bhoktum bhaikshyam apeeha loke; Hatwaarthakaamaamstu guroon ihaiva Bhunjeeya bhogaan rudhirapradigdhaan. . Better it is, indeed, in this world to accept alms than to slay the most noble teachers. But if I kill them, even in this world all my enjoyments of wealth and desires will be stained with their blood. Na chaitad vidmah kataran no gareeyo Yadwaa jayema yadi vaa no jayeyuh; Yaan eva hatwaa na jijeevishaamas Tevasthitaah pramukhe dhaartaraashtraah. . I can hardly tell which will be better: that we should conquer them or they should conquer us. Even the sons of Dhritarashtra, after slaying whom we do not wish to live, stand facing us. Kaarpanyadoshopahataswabhaavah Pricchaami twaam dharmasammoodha chetaah; Yacchreyah syaan nishchitam broohi tanme Shishyasteham shaadhi maam twaam prapannam. . My heart is overpowered by the taint of pity, my mind is confused as to duty. I ask Thee: tell me decisively what is good for me. I am Thy disciple. Instruct me who has taken refuge in Thee. Na hi prapashyaami mamaapanudyaad Yacchokam ucchoshanam indriyaanaam; Avaapya bhoomaavasapatnam riddham Raajyam suraanaam api chaadhipatyam. . I do not see that it would remove this sorrow that burns up my senses even if I should attain prosperous and unrivalled dominion on earth or lordship over the gods. Sanjaya Uvaacha: Evam uktwaa hrisheekesham gudaakeshah parantapah; Na yotsya iti govindam uktwaa tooshneem babhoova ha. Sanjaya said: . Having spoken thus to Hrishikesa Lord of the senses, Arjuna the conqueror of sleep, the destroyer of foes, said to Krishna: I will not fight, and became silent. Tam uvaacha hrisheekeshah prahasanniva bhaarata; Senayor ubhayor madhye visheedantam idam vachah. . To him who was despondent in the midst of the two armies, Sri Krishna, as if smiling, O Bharata, spoke these words! Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha: Ashochyaan anvashochastwam prajnaavaadaamshcha bhaashase; Gataasoon agataasoomshcha naanushochanti panditaah. The Blessed Lord said: . Thou hast grieved for those that should not be grieved for, yet thou speakest words of wisdom. The wise grieve neither for the living nor for the dead. Na twevaaham jaatu naasam na twam neme janaadhipaah; Na chaiva na bhavishyaamah sarve vayam atah param. . Nor at any time indeed was I not, nor these rulers of men, nor verily shall we ever cease to be hereafter. Dehinosmin yathaa dehe kaumaaram yauvanam jaraa; Tathaa dehaantara praaptir dheeras tatra na muhyati. . Just as in this body the embodied soul passes into childhood, youth and old age, so also does he pass into another body; the firm man does not grieve thereat. Maatraasparshaastu kaunteya sheetoshnasukhaduhkhadaah; Aagamaapaayinonityaas taamstitikshaswa bhaarata. . The contacts of the senses with the objects, O son of Kunti, which cause heat and cold and pleasure and pain, have a beginning and an end; they are impermanent; endure them bravely, O Arjuna! Yam hi na vyathayantyete purusham purusharshabha; Samaduhkha sukham dheeram somritatwaaya kalpate. . That firm man whom surely these afflict not, O chief among men, to whom pleasure and pain are the same, is fit for attaining immortality! Naasato vidyate bhaavo naabhaavo vidyate satah; Ubhayorapi drishtontastwanayos tattwadarshibhih. . The unreal hath no being; there is no non-being of the Real; the truth about both has been seen by the knowers of the Truth or the seers of the Essence. COMMENTARY: What is changing must always be unreal. What is constant or permanent must always be real. The Atman or the eternal, all-pervading Self ever exists. It is the only Reality. This phenomenal world of names and forms is ever changing. Names and forms are subject to decay and death. Hence they are unreal or impermanent. Avinaashi tu tad viddhi yena sarvam idam tatam; Vinaasham avyayasyaasya na kashchit kartum arhati. . Know That to be indestructible, by whom all this is pervaded. None can cause the destruction of That, the Imperishable. COMMENTARY: The Self pervades all objects like ether. Even if the pot is broken, the ether that is within and without it cannot be destroyed. Similarly, if the bodies and all other objects perish, the eternal Self that pervades them cannot be destroyed; It is the living Truth. Antavanta ime dehaa nityasyoktaah shareerinah; Anaashinoprameyasya tasmaad yudhyaswa bhaarata. . These bodies of the embodied Self, which is eternal, indestructible and immeasurable, are said to have an end. Therefore, fight, O Arjuna! Ya enam vetti hantaaram yashchainam manyate hatam; Ubhau tau na vijaaneeto naayam hanti na hanyate. . He who takes the Self to be the slayer and he who thinks He is slain, neither of them knows; He slays not nor is He slain. Na jaayate mriyate vaa kadaachin Naayam bhootwaa bhavitaa vaa na bhooyah; Ajo nityah shaashwatoyam puraano Na hanyate hanyamaane shareere. . He is not born nor does He ever die; after having been, He again ceases not to be. Unborn, eternal, changeless and ancient, He is not killed when the body is killed, Vedaavinaashinam nityam ya enam ajam avyayam; Katham sa purushah paartha kam ghaatayati hanti kam. . Whosoever knows Him to be indestructible, eternal, unborn and inexhaustible, how can that man slay, O Arjuna, or cause to be slain? Vaasaamsi jeernaani yathaa vihaaya Navaani grihnaati naroparaani; Tathaa shareeraani vihaaya jeernaa Nyanyaani samyaati navaani dehee. . Just as a man casts off worn-out clothes and puts on new ones, so also the embodied Self casts off worn-out bodies and enters others that are new. Nainam cchindanti shastraani nainam dahati paavakah; Na chainam kledayantyaapo na shoshayati maarutah. . Weapons cut It not, fire burns It not, water wets It not, wind dries It not. COMMENTARY: The Self is partless. It is infinite and extremely subtle. So the sword cannot cut It, fire cannot burn It, wind cannot dry It. Acchedyoyam adaahyoyam akledyoshoshya eva cha; Nityah sarvagatah sthaanur achaloyam sanaatanah. . This Self cannot be cut, burnt, wetted nor dried up. It is eternal, all-pervading, stable, ancient and immovable. Avyaktoyam achintyoyam avikaaryoyam uchyate; Tasmaad evam viditwainam naanushochitum arhasi. . This Self is said to be unmanifested, unthinkable and unchangeable. Therefore, knowing This to be such, thou shouldst not grieve. Atha chainam nityajaatam nityam vaa manyase mritam; Tathaapi twam mahaabaaho naivam shochitum arhasi. . But, even if thou thinkest of It as being constantly born and dying, even then, O mighty-armed, thou shouldst not grieve! COMMENTARY: Birth is inevitable to what is dead and death is inevitable to what is born. This is the law of Nature. Therefore, one should not grieve. Jaatasya hi dhruvo mrityur dhruvam janma mritasya cha; Tasmaad aparihaaryerthe na twam shochitum arhasi. . For, certain is death for the born and certain is birth for the dead; therefore, over the inevitable thou shouldst not grieve. Avyaktaadeeni bhootaani vyaktamadhyaani bhaarata; Avyakta nidhanaanyeva tatra kaa paridevanaa. . Beings are unmanifested in their beginning, manifested in their middle state, O Arjuna, and unmanifested again in their end! What is there to grieve about? COMMENTARY: The physical body is a combination of the five elements. It is perceived by the physical eye only after the five elements have entered into such combination. After death the body disintegrates and all the five elements return to their source. The body cannot be perceived now. It can be perceived only in the middle state. He who understands the nature of the body and human relationships based upon it will not grieve. Aashcharyavat pashyati kashchid enam Aashcharyavad vadati tathaiva chaanyah; Aashcharyavacchainam anyah shrinoti Shrutwaapyenam veda na chaiva kashchit. . One sees This the Self as a wonder; another speaks of It as a wonder; another hears of It as a wonder; yet, having heard, none understands It at all. COMMENTARY: The verse may also be interpreted in this manner: he that sees, hears and speaks of the Self is a wonderful man. Such a man is very rare. He is one among many thousands. Therefore, the Self is very hard to understand. Dehee nityam avadhyoyam dehe sarvasya bhaarata; Tasmaat sarvaani bhootaani na twam shochitum arhasi. . This, the Indweller in the body of everyone, is always indestructible, O Arjuna! Therefore, thou shouldst not grieve for any creature. Swadharmam api chaavekshya na vikampitum arhasi; Dharmyaaddhi yuddhaacchreyonyat kshatriyasya na vidyate. . Further, having regard to thy own duty, thou shouldst not waver, for there is nothing higher for a Kshatriya than a righteous war. COMMENTARY: To a Kshatriya one born in the warrior or ruling class nothing is more welcome than a righteous war. Yadricchayaa chopapannam swargadwaaram apaavritam; Sukhinah kshatriyaah paartha labhante yuddham eedrisham. . Happy are the Kshatriyas, O Arjuna, who are called upon to fight in such a battle that comes of itself as an open door to heaven! COMMENTARY: The scriptures declare that if a warrior dies for a righteous cause on the battlefield he at once ascends to heaven. Atha chettwam imam dharmyam samgraamam na karishyasi; Tatah swadharmam keertim cha hitwaa paapam avaapsyasi. . But, if thou wilt not fight in this righteous war, then, having abandoned thine duty and fame, thou shalt incur sin. Akeertim chaapi bhootaani kathayishyanti tevyayaam; Sambhaavitasya chaakeertir maranaad atirichyate. . People, too, will recount thy everlasting dishonour; and to one who has been honoured, dishonour is worse than death. Bhayaad ranaad uparatam mamsyante twaam mahaarathaah; Yeshaam cha twam bahumato bhootwaa yaasyasi laaghavam. . The great car-warriors will think that thou hast withdrawn from the battle through fear; and thou wilt be lightly held by them who have thought much of thee. Avaachyavaadaamshcha bahoon vadishyanti tavaahitaah; Nindantastava saamarthyam tato duhkhataram nu kim. . Thy enemies also, cavilling at thy power, will speak many abusive words. What is more painful than this! Hato vaa praapsyasi swargam jitwaa vaa bhokshyase maheem; Tasmaad uttishtha kaunteya yuddhaaya kritanishchayah. . Slain, thou wilt obtain heaven; victorious, thou wilt enjoy the earth; therefore, stand up, O son of Kunti, resolved to fight! Sukhaduhkhe same kritwaa laabhaalaabhau jayaajayau; Tato yuddhaaya yujyaswa naivam paapamavaapsyasi. . Having made pleasure and pain, gain and loss, victory and defeat the same, engage thou in battle for the sake of battle; thus thou shalt not incur sin. COMMENTARY: This is the Yoga of equanimity or the doctrine of poise in action. If a person performs actions with the above mental attitude, he will not reap the fruits of such actions. Eshaa tebhihitaa saankhye buddhir yoge twimaam shrinu; Buddhyaa yukto yayaa paartha karma bandham prahaasyasi. . This which has been taught to thee, is wisdom concerning Sankhya. Now listen to wisdom concerning Yoga, endowed with which, O Arjuna, thou shalt cast off the bonds of action! Nehaabhikramanaashosti pratyavaayo na vidyate; Swalpam apyasya dharmasya traayate mahato bhayaat. . In this there is no loss of effort, nor is there any harm the production of contrary results or transgression. Even a little of this knowledge even a little practice of this Yoga protects one from great fear. COMMENTARY: In Karma Yoga selfless action even a little effort brings immediate purification of the heart. Purification of the heart leads to fearlessness. Vyavasaayaatmikaa buddhir ekeha kurunandana; Bahushaakhaa hyanantaashcha buddhayovyavasaayinaam. . Here, O joy of the Kurus, there is a single one-pointed determination! Many-branched and endless are the thoughts of the irresolute. Yaam imaam pushpitaam vaacham pravadantyavipashchitah; Vedavaadarataah paartha naanyad asteeti vaadinah. . Flowery speech is uttered by the unwise, who take pleasure in the eulogising words of the Vedas, O Arjuna, saying: There is nothing else! COMMENTARY: Unwise people who lack discrimination place great stress upon the Karma Kanda or ritualistic portion of the Vedas which lays down specific rules for specific actions for the attainment of specific fruit. They extol these actions and rewards unduly. Kaamaatmaanah swargaparaa janmakarmaphalapradaam; Kriyaavisheshabahulaam bhogaishwaryagatim prati. . Full of desires, having heaven as their goal, they utter speech which promises birth as the reward of ones actions, and prescribe various specific actions for the attainment of pleasure and power. Bhogaishwarya prasaktaanaam tayaapahritachetasaam; Vyavasaayaatmikaa buddhih samaadhau na vidheeyate. . For those who are much attached to pleasure and to power, whose minds are drawn away by such teaching, that determinate faculty is not manifest that is steadily bent on meditation and Samadhi the state of Superconsciousness. Traigunyavishayaa vedaa nistraigunyo bhavaarjuna; Nirdwandwo nityasatwastho niryogakshema aatmavaan. . The Vedas deal with the three attributes of Nature; be thou above these three attributes, O Arjuna! Free yourself from the pairs of opposites and ever remain in the quality of Sattwa goodness, freed from the thought of acquisition and preservation, and be established in the Self. COMMENTARY: Guna means attribute or quality. It is substance as well as quality. Nature is made up of three GunasSattwa purity, light, harmony, Rajas passion, restlessness, motion, and Tamas inertia, darkness. The pairs of opposites are pleasure and pain, heat and cold, gain and loss, victory and defeat, honour and dishonour, praise and censure. Yaavaanartha udapaane sarvatah samplutodake; Taavaan sarveshu vedeshu braahmanasya vijaanatah. . To the Brahmana who has known the Self, all the Vedas are of as much use as is a reservoir of water in a place where there is a flood. COMMENTARY: Only for a sage who has realised the Self are the Vedas of no use, because he is in possession of knowledge of the Self. This does not, however, mean that the Vedas are useless. They are useful for neophytes or aspirants who have just started on the spiritual path. Karmanyevaadhikaaraste maa phaleshu kadaachana; Maa karmaphalahetur bhoor maa te sangostwakarmani. . Thy right is to work only, but never with its fruits; let not the fruits of actions be thy motive, nor let thy attachment be to inaction. COMMENTARY: Actions done with expectation of its rewards bring bondage. If you do not thirst for them, you get purification of heart and ultimately knowledge of the Self. Yogasthah kuru karmaani sangam tyaktwaa dhananjaya; Siddhyasiddhyoh samo bhootwaa samatwam yoga uchyate. . Perform action, O Arjuna, being steadfast in Yoga, abandoning attachment and balanced in success and failure! Evenness of mind is called Yoga. Doorena hyavaram karma buddhiyogaad dhananjaya; Buddhau sharanamanwiccha kripanaah phalahetavah. . Far lower than the Yoga of wisdom is action, O Arjuna! Seek thou refuge in wisdom; wretched are they whose motive is the fruit. COMMENTARY: Actions done with evenness of mind is the Yoga of wisdom. Actions performed by one who expects their fruits are far inferior to the Yoga of wisdom wherein the seeker does not seek the fruits. The former leads to bondage, and is the cause of birth and death. Buddhiyukto jahaateeha ubhe sukrita dushkrite; Tasmaad yogaaya yujyaswa yogah karmasu kaushalam. . Endowed with wisdom evenness of mind, one casts off in this life both good and evil deeds; therefore, devote thyself to Yoga; Yoga is skill in action. COMMENTARY: Actions which are of a binding nature lose that nature when performed with equanimity of mind. Karmajam buddhiyuktaa hi phalam tyaktwaa maneeshinah; Janmabandha vinirmuktaah padam gacchantyanaamayam. . The wise, possessed of knowledge, having abandoned the fruits of their actions, and being freed from the fetters of birth, go to the place which is beyond all evil. COMMENTARY: Clinging to the fruits of actions is the cause of rebirth. Man has to take a body to enjoy them. If actions are done for the sake of God, without desire for the fruits, one is released from the bonds of birth and death and attains to immortal bliss. Yadaa te mohakalilam buddhir vyatitarishyati; Tadaa gantaasi nirvedam shrotavyasya shrutasya cha. . When thy intellect crosses beyond the mire of delusion, then thou shalt attain to indifference as to what has been heard and what has yet to be heard. COMMENTARY: The mire of delusion is identification of the Self with the body and mind. Shrutivipratipannaa te yadaa sthaasyati nishchalaa; Samaadhaavachalaa buddhistadaa yogam avaapsyasi. . When thy intellect, perplexed by what thou hast heard, shall stand immovable and steady in the Self, then thou shalt attain Self-realisation. Arjuna Uvaacha: Sthitaprajnasya kaa bhaashaa samaadhisthasya keshava; Sthitadheeh kim prabhaasheta kimaaseeta vrajeta kim. Arjuna said: . What, O Krishna, is the description of him who has steady wisdom and is merged in the Superconscious State? How does one of steady wisdom speak? How does he sit? How does he walk? Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha: Prajahaati yadaa kaamaan sarvaan paartha manogataan; Aatmanyevaatmanaa tushtah sthitaprajnastadochyate. The Blessed Lord said: . When a man completely casts off, O Arjuna, all the desires of the mind and is satisfied in the Self by the Self, then is he said to be one of steady wisdom! COMMENTARY: All the pleasures of the world are worthless to an illumined sage who is ever content in the immortal Self. Duhkheshwanudwignamanaah sukheshu vigatasprihah; Veetaraagabhayakrodhah sthitadheer munir uchyate. . He whose mind is not shaken by adversity, who does not hanker after pleasures, and who is free from attachment, fear and anger, is called a sage of steady wisdom. Yah sarvatraanabhisnehas tattat praapya shubhaashubham; Naabhinandati na dweshti tasya prajnaa pratishthitaa. . He who is everywhere without attachment, on meeting with anything good or bad, who neither rejoices nor hates, his wisdom is fixed. Yadaa samharate chaayam kurmongaaneeva sarvashah; Indriyaaneendriyaarthebhyas tasya prajnaa pratishthitaa. . When, like the tortoise which withdraws its limbs on all sides, he withdraws his senses from the sense-objects, then his wisdom becomes steady. Vishayaa vinivartante niraahaarasya dehinah Rasavarjam rasopyasya param drishtwaa nivartate. . The objects of the senses turn away from the abstinent man, leaving the longing behind; but his longing also turns away on seeing the Supreme. Yatato hyapi kaunteya purushasya vipashchitah; Indriyaani pramaatheeni haranti prasabham manah. . The turbulent senses, O Arjuna, do violently carry away the mind of a wise man though he be striving to control them! Taani sarvaani samyamya yukta aaseeta matparah; Vashe hi yasyendriyaani tasya prajnaa pratishthitaa. . Having restrained them all he should sit steadfast, intent on Me; his wisdom is steady whose senses are under control. Dhyaayato vishayaan pumsah sangas teshupajaayate; Sangaat sanjaayate kaamah kaamaat krodhobhijaayate. . When a man thinks of the objects, attachment to them arises; from attachment desire is born; from desire anger arises. Krodhaad bhavati sammohah sammohaat smriti vibhramah; Smritibhramshaad buddhinaasho buddhinaashaat pranashyati. . From anger comes delusion; from delusion the loss of memory; from loss of memory the destruction of discrimination; from the destruction of discrimination he perishes. Raagadwesha viyuktaistu vishayaanindriyaishcharan; Aatmavashyair vidheyaatmaa prasaadamadhigacchati. . But the self-controlled man, moving amongst objects with the senses under restraint, and free from attraction and repulsion, attains to peace. Prasaade sarvaduhkhaanaam haanir asyopajaayate; Prasannachetaso hyaashu buddhih paryavatishthate. . In that peace all pains are destroyed, for the intellect of the tranquil-minded soon becomes steady. COMMENTARY: When peace is attained all miseries end. Naasti buddhir ayuktasya na chaayuktasya bhaavanaa; Na chaabhaavayatah shaantir ashaantasya kutah sukham. . There is no knowledge of the Self to the unsteady, and to the unsteady no meditation is possible; and to the un-meditative there can be no peace; and to the man who has no peace, how can there be happiness? Indriyaanaam hi charataam yanmanonuvidheeyate; Tadasya harati prajnaam vaayur naavam ivaambhasi. . For the mind which follows in the wake of the wandering senses, carries away his discrimination as the wind carries away a boat on the waters. Tasmaad yasya mahaabaaho nigriheetaani sarvashah; Indriyaaneendriyaarthebhyas tasya prajnaa pratishthitaa. . Therefore, O mighty-armed Arjuna, his knowledge is steady whose senses are completely restrained from sense-objects! Yaanishaa sarvabhootaanaam tasyaam jaagarti samyamee; Yasyaam jaagrati bhootaani saa nishaa pashyato muneh. . That which is night to all beings, then the self-controlled man is awake; when all beings are awake, that is night for the sage who sees. COMMENTARY: The sage lives in the Self; this is day to him. He is unconscious of worldly phenomena; this is like night to him. The ordinary man is unconscious of his real nature. So life in the Self is like night to him. He experiences sense-objects; this is day to him. Aapooryamaanam achalapratishtham Samudram aapah pravishanti yadwat; Tadwat kaamaa yam pravishanti sarve Sa shaantim aapnoti na kaamakaami. . He attains peace into whom all desires enter as waters enter the ocean, which, filled from all sides, remains unmoved; but not the man who is full of desires. Vihaaya kaamaan yah sarvaan pumaamshcharati nihsprihah; Nirmamo nirahankaarah sa shaantim adhigacchati. . The man attains peace, who, abandoning all desires, moves about without longing, without the sense of mine and without egoism. Eshaa braahmee sthitih paartha nainaam praapya vimuhyati; Sthitwaasyaamantakaalepi brahmanirvaanamricchati. . This is the Brahmic seat eternal state, O son of Pritha! Attaining to this, none is deluded. Being established therein, even at the end of life one attains to oneness with Brahman. Hari Om Tat Sat Iti Srimad Bhagavadgeetaasoopanishatsu Brahmavidyaayaam Yogashaastre Sri Krishnaarjunasamvaade Saankhyayogo Naama Dvitiyodhyaayah Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita, the science of the Eternal, the scripture of Yoga, the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna, ends the second discourse entitled: The Sankhya Yoga III The Yoga of Action Summary of Third Discourse In order to remove Moha or attachment, which was the sole cause of Arjunas delusion, Sri Krishna taught him the imperishable nature of the Atman, the realisation of which would grant him the freedom of the Eternal. A doubt therefore arises in Arjunas mind as to the necessity of engaging in action even after one has attained this state. Sri Krishna clears this doubt by telling him that although one has realised oneness with the Eternal, one has to perform action through the force of Prakriti or Nature. He emphasises that perfection is attained not by ceasing to engage in action but by doing all actions as a divine offering, imbued with a spirit of non-attachment and sacrifice. The man of God-vision, Sri Krishna explains to Arjuna, need not engage in action, as he has attained everything that has to be attained. He can be ever absorbed in the calm and immutable Self. But to perform action for the good of the world and for the education of the masses is no doubt superior. Therefore, action is necessary not only for one who has attained perfection but also for one who is striving for perfection. Sri Krishna quotes the example of Janaka, the great sage-king of India, who continued to rule his kingdom even after attaining God-realisation. Prakriti or Nature is made up of the three qualitiesRajas, Tamas and Sattwa. The Atman is beyond these three qualities and their functions. Only when knowledge of this fact dawns in man does he attain perfection. The Lord tells Arjuna that each one should do his duty according to his nature, and that doing duty that is suited to ones nature in the right spirit of detachment will lead to perfection. Arjuna raises the question as to why man commits such actions that cloud his mind and drag him downwards, by force, as it were. Sri Krishna answers that it is desire that impels man to lose his discrimination and understanding, and thus commit wrong actions. Desire is the root cause of all evil actions. If desire is removed, then the divine power manifests in its full glory and one enjoys peace, bliss, light and freedom. Arjuna Uvaacha Jyaayasee chet karmanaste mataa buddhir janaardana; Tat kim karmani ghore maam niyojayasi keshava. Arjuna said: . If it be thought by Thee that knowledge is superior to action, O Krishna, why then, O Kesava, dost Thou ask me to engage in this terrible action? Vyaamishreneva vaakyena buddhim mohayaseeva me; Tadekam vada nishchitya yena shreyoham aapnuyaam. . With these apparently perplexing words Thou confusest, as it were, my understanding; therefore, tell me that one way for certain by which I may attain bliss. Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha: Lokesmin dwividhaa nishthaa puraa proktaa mayaanagha; Jnaanayogena saankhyaanaam karmayogena yoginaam. The Blessed Lord said: . In this world there is a twofold path, as I said before, O sinless one,the path of knowledge of the Sankhyas and the path of action of the Yogis! Na karmanaam anaarambhaan naishkarmyam purushoshnute; Na cha sannyasanaad eva siddhim samadhigacchati. . Not by the non-performance of actions does man reach actionlessness, nor by mere renunciation does he attain to perfection. COMMENTARY: Even if a man abandons action, his mind may be active. One cannot reach perfection or freedom from action or knowledge of the Self, merely by renouncing action. He must possess knowledge of the Self. Na hi kashchit kshanamapi jaatu tishthatyakarmakrit; Kaaryate hyavashah karma sarvah prakritijair gunaih. . Verily none can ever remain for even a moment without performing action; for, everyone is made to act helplessly indeed by the qualities born of Nature. COMMENTARY: The ignorant man is driven to action helplessly by the actions of the GunasRajas, Tamas and Sattwa. Karmendriyaani samyamya ya aaste manasaa smaran; Indriyaarthaan vimoodhaatmaa mithyaachaarah sa uchyate. . He who, restraining the organs of action, sits thinking of the sense-objects in mind, he, of deluded understanding, is called a hypocrite. Yastwindriyaani manasaa niyamyaarabhaterjuna; Karmendriyaih karmayogam asaktah sa vishishyate. . But whosoever, controlling the senses by the mind, O Arjuna, engages himself in Karma Yoga with the organs of action, without attachment, he excels! Niyatam kuru karma twam karma jyaayo hyakarmanah; Shareerayaatraapi cha te na prasiddhyed akarmanah. . Do thou perform thy bounden duty, for action is superior to inaction and even the maintenance of the body would not be possible for thee by inaction. Yajnaarthaat karmanonyatra lokoyam karmabandhanah; Tadartham karma kaunteya muktasangah samaachara. . The world is bound by actions other than those performed for the sake of sacrifice; do thou, therefore, O son of Kunti, perform action for that sake for sacrifice alone, free from attachment! COMMENTARY: If anyone does actions for the sake of the Lord, he is not bound. His heart is purified by performing actions for the sake of the Lord. Where this spirit of unselfishness does not govern the action, such actions bind one to worldliness, however good or glorious they may be. Sahayajnaah prajaah srishtwaa purovaacha prajaapatih; Anena prasavishyadhwam esha vostvishtakaamadhuk. . The Creator, having in the beginning of creation created mankind together with sacrifice, said: By this shall ye propagate; let this be the milch cow of your desires the cow which yields the desired objects. Devaan bhaavayataanena te devaa bhaavayantu vah; Parasparam bhaavayantah shreyah param avaapsyatha. . With this do ye nourish the gods, and may the gods nourish you; thus nourishing one another, ye shall attain to the highest good. Ishtaan bhogaan hi vo devaa daasyante yajnabhaavitaah; Tair dattaan apradaayaibhyo yo bhungkte stena eva sah. . The gods, nourished by the sacrifice, will give you the desired objects. So, he who enjoys the objects given by the gods without offering in return to them, is verily a thief. Yajnashishtaashinah santo muchyante sarva kilbishaih; Bhunjate te twagham paapaa ye pachantyaatma kaaranaat. . The righteous, who eat of the remnants of the sacrifice, are freed from all sins; but those sinful ones who cook food only for their own sake, verily eat sin. Annaad bhavanti bhootaani parjanyaad anna sambhavah; Yajnaad bhavati parjanyo yajnah karma samudbhavah. . From food come forth beings, and from rain food is produced; from sacrifice arises rain, and sacrifice is born of action. Karma brahmodbhavam viddhi brahmaakshara samudbhavam; Tasmaat sarvagatam brahma nityam yajne pratishthitam. . Know thou that action comes from Brahma, and Brahma proceeds from the Imperishable. Therefore, the all-pervading Brahma ever rests in sacrifice. Evam pravartitam chakram naanuvartayateeha yah; Aghaayur indriyaaraamo mogham paartha sa jeevati. . He who does not follow the wheel thus set revolving, who is of sinful life, rejoicing in the senses, he lives in vain, O Arjuna! COMMENTARY: He who does not follow the wheel by studying the Vedas and performing the sacrifices prescribed therein, but who indulges only in sensual pleasures, lives in vain. He wastes his life. Yastwaatmaratir eva syaad aatmatriptashcha maanavah; Aatmanyeva cha santushtas tasya kaaryam na vidyate. . But for that man who rejoices only in the Self, who is satisfied in the Self, who is content in the Self alone, verily there is nothing to do. Naiva tasya kritenaartho naakriteneha kashchana; Na chaasya sarvabhooteshu kashchidartha vyapaashrayah. . For him there is no interest whatsoever in what is done or what is not done; nor does he depend on any being for any object. COMMENTARY: The sage who rejoices in his own Self does not gain anything by doing any action. To him no real purpose is served by engaging in any action. No evil can touch him as a result of inaction. He does not lose anything by being inactive. Tasmaad asaktah satatam kaaryam karma samaachara; Asakto hyaacharan karma param aapnoti poorushah. . Therefore, without attachment, do thou always perform action which should be done; for, by performing action without attachment man reaches the Supreme. Karmanaiva hi samsiddhim aasthitaa janakaadayah; Lokasangraham evaapi sampashyan kartum arhasi. . Janaka and others attained perfection verily by action only; even with a view to the protection of the masses thou shouldst perform action. Yadyad aacharati shreshthas tattadevetaro janah; Sa yat pramaanam kurute lokas tad anuvartate. . Whatsoever a great man does, that other men also do; whatever he sets up as the standard, that the world follows. Na me paarthaasti kartavyam trishu lokeshu kinchana; Naanavaaptam avaaptavyam varta eva cha karmani. . There is nothing in the three worlds, O Arjuna, that should be done by Me, nor is there anything unattained that should be attained; yet I engage Myself in action! Yadi hyaham na varteyam jaatu karmanyatandritah; Mama vartmaanuvartante manushyaah paartha sarvashah. . For, should I not ever engage Myself in action, unwearied, men would in every way follow My path, O Arjuna! Utseedeyur ime lokaa na kuryaam karma ched aham; Sankarasya cha kartaa syaam upahanyaam imaah prajaah. . These worlds would perish if I did not perform action; I should be the author of confusion of castes and destruction of these beings. Saktaah karmanyavidwaamso yathaa kurvanti bhaarata; Kuryaad vidwaam stathaa saktash chikeershur lokasangraham. . As the ignorant men act from attachment to action, O Bharata Arjuna, so should the wise act without attachment, wishing the welfare of the world! Na buddhibhedam janayed ajnaanaam karmasanginaam; Joshayet sarva karmaani vidwaan yuktah samaacharan. . Let no wise man unsettle the minds of ignorant people who are attached to action; he should engage them in all actions, himself fulfilling them with devotion. Prakriteh kriyamaanaani gunaih karmaani sarvashah; Ahamkaaravimoodhaatmaa kartaaham iti manyate. . All actions are wrought in all cases by the qualities of Nature only. He whose mind is deluded by egoism thinks: I am the doer. COMMENTARY: Prakriti or Nature is that state in which the three Gunas exist in a state of equilibrium. When this equilibrium is disturbed, creation begins and the body, senses and mind are formed. The man who is deluded by egoism identifies the Self with the body, mind, the life-force and the senses, and ascribes to the Self all the attributes of the body and the senses. In reality the Gunas of nature perform all actions. Tattwavittu mahaabaaho gunakarma vibhaagayoh; Gunaa guneshu vartanta iti matwaa na sajjate. . But he who knows the truth, O mighty-armed Arjuna, about the divisions of the qualities and their functions, knowing that the Gunas as senses move amidst the Gunas as the sense-objects, is not attached. Prakriter gunasammoodhaah sajjante gunakarmasu; Taan akritsnavido mandaan kritsnavin na vichaalayet. . Those deluded by the qualities of Nature are attached to the functions of the qualities. A man of perfect knowledge should not unsettle the foolish one of imperfect knowledge. Mayi sarvaani karmaani sannyasyaadhyaatma chetasaa; Niraasheer nirmamo bhootwaa yudhyaswa vigatajwarah. . Renouncing all actions in Me, with the mind centred in the Self, free from hope and egoism, and from mental fever, do thou fight. COMMENTARY: Surrender all actions to Me with the thought: I perform all actions for the sake of the Lord only. Ye me matam idam nityam anutishthanti maanavaah; Shraddhaavantonasooyanto muchyante tepi karmabhih. . Those men who constantly practise this teaching of Mine with faith and without cavilling, they too are freed from actions. Ye twetad abhyasooyanto naanutishthanti me matam; Sarvajnaanavimoodhaam staan viddhi nashtaan achetasah. . But those who carp at My teaching and do not practise it, deluded in all knowledge and devoid of discrimination, know them to be doomed to destruction. Sadrisham cheshtate swasyaah prakriter jnaanavaan api; Prakritim yaanti bhootaani nigrahah kim karishyati. . Even a wise man acts in accordance with his own nature; beings will follow nature; what can restraint do? COMMENTARY: Only the ignorant man comes under the sway of his natural propensities. The seeker after Truth who is endowed with the Four Means and who constantly practises meditation, can easily control Nature if he rises above the sway of the pairs of opposites, like love and hate, etc. Indriyasyendriyasyaarthe raagadweshau vyavasthitau; Tayor na vasham aagacchet tau hyasya paripanthinau. . Attachment and aversion for the objects of the senses abide in the senses; let none come under their sway, for they are his foes. Shreyaan swadharmo vigunah paradharmaat swanushthitaat; Swadharme nidhanam shreyah paradharmo bhayaavahah. . Better is ones own duty, though devoid of merit, than the duty of another well discharged. Better is death in ones own duty; the duty of another is fraught with fear. Arjuna Uvaacha: Atha kena prayuktoyam paapam charati poorushah; Anicchann api vaarshneya balaad iva niyojitah. Arjuna said: . But impelled by what does man commit sin, though against his wishes, O Varshneya Krishna, constrained, as it were, by force? Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha: Kaama esha krodha esha rajoguna samudbhavah; Mahaashano mahaapaapmaa viddhyenam iha vairinam. The Blessed Lord said: . It is desire, it is anger born of the quality of Rajas, all-sinful and all-devouring; know this as the foe here in this world. Dhoomenaavriyate vahnir yathaadarsho malena cha; Yatholbenaavrito garbhas tathaa tenedam aavritam. . As fire is enveloped by smoke, as a mirror by dust, and as an embryo by the amnion, so is this enveloped by that. Aavritam jnaanam etena jnaanino nityavairinaa; Kaamaroopena kaunteya dushpoorenaanalena cha. . O Arjuna, wisdom is enveloped by this constant enemy of the wise in the form of desire, which is unappeasable as fire! Indriyaani mano buddhir asyaadhishthaanam uchyate; Etair vimohayatyesha jnaanam aavritya dehinam. . The senses, mind and intellect are said to be its seat; through these it deludes the embodied by veiling his wisdom. Tasmaat twam indriyaanyaadau niyamya bharatarshabha; Paapmaanam prajahi hyenam jnaana vijnaana naashanam. . Therefore, O best of the Bharatas Arjuna, controlling the senses first, do thou kill this sinful thing desire, the destroyer of knowledge and realisation! Indriyaani paraanyaahur indriyebhyah param manah; Manasastu paraa buddhir yo buddheh paratastu sah. . They say that the senses are superior to the body; superior to the senses is the mind; superior to the mind is the intellect; and one who is superior even to the intellect is Hethe Self. Evam buddheh param buddhwaa samstabhyaatmaanam aatmanaa; Jahi shatrum mahaabaaho kaamaroopam duraasadam. . Thus, knowing Him who is superior to the intellect and restraining the self by the Self, slay thou, O mighty-armed Arjuna, the enemy in the form of desire, hard to conquer! COMMENTARY: Restrain the lower self by the higher Self. Subdue the lower mind by the higher mind. It is difficult to conquer desire because it is of a highly complex and incomprehensible nature. But a man of discrimination and dispassion, who does constant and intense Sadhana, can conquer it quite easily. Hari Om Tat Sat Iti Srimad Bhagavadgeetaasoopanishatsu Brahmavidyaayaam Yogashaastre Sri Krishnaarjunasamvaade Karmayogo Naama Tritiyodhyaayah Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita, the science of the Eternal, the scripture of Yoga, the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna, ends the third discourse entitled: The Yoga of Action IV The Yoga of Wisdom Summary of Fourth Discourse Lord Krishna declares that He is born from age to age, in order to raise man and take him to the Supreme. Whenever there is a prevalence of unrighteousness and the world is ruled by the forces of darkness, the Lord manifests Himself to destroy these adverse forces and to establish peace, order and harmony. Hence we see the appearance of the great saviours of the world. What is the secret of Yogic action? This the Lord proceeds to explain to Arjuna. Even though one is not engaged in action, but if the mind is active with the idea of doership and egoism, then it is action in inaction. On the other hand, though engaged physically in intense action, if the idea of agency is absent, if one feels that Prakriti does everything, it is inaction in action. The liberated man is free from attachment and is always calm and serene though engaged in ceaseless action. He is unaffected by the pairs of opposites like joy and grief, success and failure. One who has true union with the Lord is not subject to rebirth. He attains immortality. Such a union can only be achieved when one is free from attachment, fear and anger, being thoroughly purified by right knowledge. The Lord accepts the devotion of all, whatever path they may use to approach Him. Various kinds of sacrifices are performed by those engaged in the path to God. Through the practice of these sacrifices the mind is purified and led Godward. Here also there must be the spirit of non-attachment to the fruits of actions. Divine wisdom, according to Sri Krishna, should be sought at the feet of a liberated Guru, one who has realised the Truth. The aspirant should approach such a sage in a spirit of humility and devotion. God Himself manifests in the heart of the Guru and instructs the disciple. Having understood the Truth from the Guru by direct intuitive experience the aspirant is no longer deluded by ignorance. The liberated aspirant directly beholds the Self in all beings and all beings in the Self. He cognises through internal experience or intuition that all beings, from the Creator down to a blade of grass, exist in his own Self and also in God. Arjuna is given the most heartening assurance that divine wisdom liberates even the most sinful. When knowledge of the Self dawns, all actions with their results are burnt by the fire of that knowledge, just as fuel is burnt by fire. When there is no idea of egoism, when there is no desire for the fruits of ones actions, actions are no actions. They lose their potency. In order to attain divine wisdom one must have supreme faith and devotion. Faith is therefore the most important qualification for a spiritual aspirant. The doubting mind is always led astray from the right path. Faith ultimately confers divine knowledge, which removes ignorance once and for all. Mere intellectual knowledge does not lead to liberation. It cannot grant one supreme peace and freedom. When one has achieved complete self-mastery and self-control, when one has intense faith and devotion, then true knowledge dawns within and one attains liberation and freedom from all weaknesses and sins. The Lord concludes by emphasising that the soul that doubts goes to destruction. Without faith in oneself, in the scriptures and in the words of the preceptor, one cannot make any headway on the spiritual path. It is doubt that prevents one from engaging in spiritual Sadhana and realising the highest knowledge and bliss. By following the instructions of the Guru and through sincere service, ones doubts are rent asunder and divine knowledge manifests itself within. Spiritual progress then goes on at a rapid pace. Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha: Imam vivaswate yogam proktavaan aham avyayam; Vivaswaan manave praaha manur ikshwaakavebraveet. The Blessed Lord said: . I taught this imperishable Yoga to Vivasvan; he told it to Manu; Manu proclaimed it to Ikshvaku. Evam paramparaa praaptam imam raajarshayo viduh; Sa kaaleneha mahataa yogo nashtah parantapa. . This, handed down thus in regular succession, the royal sages knew. This Yoga, by a long lapse of time, has been lost here, O Parantapa burner of foes! COMMENTARY: The royal sages were kings who at the same time possessed divine knowledge. They learnt this Yoga. Sa evaayam mayaa tedya yogah proktah puraatanah; Bhaktosi me sakhaa cheti rahasyam hyetad uttamam. . That same ancient Yoga has been today taught to thee by Me, for, thou art My devotee and friend; it is the supreme secret. COMMENTARY: This ancient Yoga consists of profound and subtle teachings. Hence it is the supreme secret which the Lord reveals to Arjuna. Arjuna Uvaacha: Aparam bhavato janma param janma vivaswatah; Katham etadvijaaneeyaam twam aadau proktavaan iti. Arjuna said: . Later on was Thy birth, and prior to it was the birth of Vivasvan the Sun; how am I to understand that Thou didst teach this Yoga in the beginning? Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha: Bahooni me vyateetaani janmaani tava chaarjuna; Taanyaham veda sarvaani na twam vettha parantapa. The Blessed Lord said: . Many births of Mine have passed, as well as of thine, O Arjuna! I know them all but thou knowest not, O Parantapa! Ajopi sannavyayaatmaa bhootaanaam eeshwaropi san; Prakritim swaam adhishthaaya sambhavaamyaatmamaayayaa. . Though I am unborn and of imperishable nature, and though I am the Lord of all beings, yet, ruling over My own Nature, I am born by My own Maya. Yadaa yadaa hi dharmasya glaanir bhavati bhaarata; Abhyutthaanam adharmasya tadaatmaanam srijaamyaham. . Whenever there is a decline of righteousness, O Arjuna, and rise of unrighteousness, then I manifest Myself! COMMENTARY: That which elevates a man and helps him to reach the goal of life and attain knowledge is Dharma righteousness; that which drags him into worldliness is unrighteousness. That which helps a man to attain liberation is Dharma; that which makes him irreligious is Adharma or unrighteousness. Paritraanaaya saadhoonaam vinaashaaya cha dushkritaam; Dharma samsthaapanaarthaaya sambhavaami yuge yuge. . For the protection of the good, for the destruction of the wicked, and for the establishment of righteousness, I am born in every age. Janma karma cha me divyam evam yo vetti tattwatah; Tyaktwa deham punarjanma naiti maameti sorjuna. . He who thus knows in true light My divine birth and action, after having abandoned the body is not born again; he comes to Me, O Arjuna! Veetaraagabhayakrodhaa manmayaa maam upaashritaah; Bahavo jnaana tapasaa pootaa madbhaavam aagataah. . Freed from attachment, fear and anger, absorbed in Me, taking refuge in Me, purified by the fire of knowledge, many have attained to My Being. Ye yathaa maam prapadyante taamstathaiva bhajaamyaham; Mama vartmaanuvartante manushyaah paartha sarvashah. . In whatever way men approach Me, even so do I reward them; My path do men tread in all ways, O Arjuna! Kaangkshantah karmanaam siddhim yajanta iha devataah; Kshipram hi maanushe loke siddhir bhavati karmajaa. . Those who long for success in action in this world sacrifice to the gods, because success is quickly attained by men through action. Chaaturvarnyam mayaa srishtam gunakarma vibhaagashah; Tasya kartaaram api maam viddhyakartaaram avyayam. . The fourfold caste has been created by Me according to the differentiation of Guna and Karma; though I am the author thereof, know Me as the non-doer and immutable. COMMENTARY: The four castes are Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaisya and Sudra. This division is according to the Guna and Karma. Guna is quality. Karma is the kind of work. Both Guna and Karma determine the caste of a man. In a Brahmana, Sattwa predominates. He possesses serenity, purity, self-restraint, straightforwardness and devotion. In a Kshatriya, Rajas predominates. He possesses prowess, splendour, firmness, dexterity, generosity and rulership. In a Vaisya, Rajas predominates and Tamas is subordinate to Rajas. He does the duty of ploughing, protection of cattle and trade. In a Sudra, Tamas predominates and Rajas is subordinate to the quality of Tamas. He renders service to the other three castes. Human temperaments and tendencies vary according to the Gunas. Na maam karmaani limpanti na me karmaphale sprihaa; Iti maam yobhijaanaati karmabhir na sa badhyate. . Actions do not taint Me, nor have I a desire for the fruits of actions. He who knows Me thus is not bound by actions. Evam jnaatwaa kritam karma poorvair api mumukshubhih; Kuru karmaiva tasmaat twam poorvaih poorvataram kritam. . Having known this, the ancient seekers after freedom also performed actions; therefore, do thou perform actions as did the ancients in days of yore. Kim karma kim akarmeti kavayopyatra mohitaah; Tat te karma pravakshyaami yajjnaatwaa mokshyaseshubhaat. . What is action? What is inaction? As to this even the wise are confused. Therefore, I shall teach thee such action the nature of action and inaction, by knowing which thou shalt be liberated from the evil of Samsara, the world of birth and death. Karmano hyapi boddhavyam boddhavyam cha vikarmanah; Akarmanashcha boddhavyam gahanaa karmano gatih. . For, verily the true nature of action enjoined by the scriptures should be known, also that of forbidden or unlawful action, and of inaction; hard to understand is the nature path of action. Karmanyakarma yah pashyed akarmani cha karma yah; Sa buddhimaan manushyeshu sa yuktah kritsnakarmakrit. . He who seeth inaction in action and action in inaction, he is wise among men; he is a Yogi and performer of all actions. COMMENTARY: It is the idea of agency, the idea of I am the doer that binds man to worldliness. If this idea vanishes, action is no action at all. It does not bind one to worldliness. This is inaction in action. But if a man sits quietly, thinking of actions and that he is their doer, he is ever doing actions. This is referred to as action in inaction. Yasya sarve samaarambhaah kaamasankalpa varjitaah; Jnaanaagni dagdhakarmaanam tam aahuh panditam budhaah. . He whose undertakings are all devoid of desires and selfish purposes, and whose actions have been burnt by the fire of knowledge,him the wise call a sage. Tyaktwaa karmaphalaasangam nityatripto niraashrayah; Karmanyabhipravrittopi naiva kinchit karoti sah. . Having abandoned attachment to the fruit of the action, ever content, depending on nothing, he does not do anything though engaged in activity. Niraasheer yatachittaatmaa tyaktasarvaparigrahah; Shaareeram kevalam karma kurvannaapnoti kilbisham. . Without hope and with the mind and the self controlled, having abandoned all greed, doing mere bodily action, he incurs no sin. Yadricchaalaabhasantushto dwandwaateeto vimatsarah; Samah siddhaavasiddhau cha kritwaapi na nibadhyate. . Content with what comes to him without effort, free from the pairs of opposites and envy, even-minded in success and failure, though acting, he is not bound. Gatasangasya muktasya jnaanaavasthitachetasah; Yajnaayaacharatah karma samagram pravileeyate. . To one who is devoid of attachment, who is liberated, whose mind is established in knowledge, who works for the sake of sacrifice for the sake of God, the whole action is dissolved. Brahmaarpanam brahmahavirbrahmaagnau brahmanaa hutam; Brahmaiva tena gantavyam brahmakarmasamaadhinaa. . Brahman is the oblation; Brahman is the melted butter ghee; by Brahman is the oblation poured into the fire of Brahman; Brahman verily shall be reached by him who always sees Brahman in action. COMMENTARY: This is wisdom-sacrifice, wherein the idea of Brahman is substituted for the ideas of the instrument and other accessories of action, the idea of action itself and its results. By having such an idea the whole action melts away. Daivam evaapare yajnam yoginah paryupaasate; Brahmaagnaavapare yajnam yajnenaivopajuhwati. . Some Yogis perform sacrifice to the gods alone, while others who have realised the Self offer the Self as sacrifice by the Self in the fire of Brahman alone. Shrotraadeeneendriyaanyanye samyamaagnishu juhwati; Shabdaadeen vishayaananya indriyaagnishu juhwati. . Some again offer hearing and other senses as sacrifice in the fire of restraint; others offer sound and various objects of the senses as sacrifice in the fire of the senses. Sarvaaneendriya karmaani praanakarmaani chaapare; Aatmasamyamayogaagnau juhwati jnaanadeepite. . Others again sacrifice all the functions of the senses and those of the breath vital energy or Prana in the fire of the Yoga of self-restraint kindled by knowledge. Dravyayajnaas tapoyajnaa yogayajnaastathaapare; Swaadhyaayajnaana yajnaashcha yatayah samshitavrataah. . Some again offer wealth, austerity and Yoga as sacrifice, while the ascetics of self-restraint and rigid vows offer study of scriptures and knowledge as sacrifice. Apaane juhwati praanam praanepaanam tathaapare; Praanaapaana gatee ruddhwaa praanaayaamaparaayanaah. . Others offer as sacrifice the outgoing breath in the incoming, and the incoming in the outgoing, restraining the courses of the outgoing and the incoming breaths, solely absorbed in the restraint of the breath. COMMENTARY: Some Yogis practise inhalation, some practise exhalation, and some retention of breath. This is Pranayama. Apare niyataahaaraah praanaan praaneshu juhwati; Sarvepyete yajnavido yajnakshapita kalmashaah. . Others who regulate their diet offer life-breaths in life-breaths; all these are knowers of sacrifice, whose sins are all destroyed by sacrifice. Yajnashishtaamritabhujo yaanti brahma sanaatanam; Naayam lokostyayajnasya kutonyah kurusattama. . Those who eat the remnants of the sacrifice, which are like nectar, go to the eternal Brahman. This world is not for the man who does not perform sacrifice; how then can he have the other, O Arjuna? COMMENTARY: They go to the eternal Brahman after attaining knowledge of the Self through purification of the mind by performing the above sacrifices. He who does not perform any of these is not fit even for this miserable world. How then can he hope to get a better world than this? Evam bahuvidhaa yajnaa vitataa brahmano mukhe; Karmajaan viddhi taan sarvaan evam jnaatwaa vimokshyase. . Thus, various kinds of sacrifices are spread out before Brahman literally at the mouth or face of Brahman. Know them all as born of action, and knowing thus, thou shalt be liberated. Shreyaan dravyamayaadyajnaaj jnaanayajnah parantapa; Sarvam karmaakhilam paartha jnaane parisamaapyate. . Superior is wisdom-sacrifice to sacrifice with objects, O Parantapa! All actions in their entirety, O Arjuna, culminate in knowledge! Tadviddhi pranipaatena pariprashnena sevayaa; Upadekshyanti te jnaanam jnaaninas tattwadarshinah. . Know that by long prostration, by question and by service, the wise who have realised the Truth will instruct thee in that knowledge. Yajjnaatwaa na punarmoham evam yaasyasi paandava; Yena bhootaanyasheshena drakshyasyaatmanyatho mayi. . Knowing that, thou shalt not, O Arjuna, again become deluded like this; and by that thou shalt see all beings in thy Self and also in Me! Api chedasi paapebhyah sarvebhyah paapakrittamah; Sarvam jnaanaplavenaiva vrijinam santarishyasi. . Even if thou art the most sinful of all sinners, yet thou shalt verily cross all sins by the raft of knowledge. COMMENTARY: One can overcome sin through Self-knowledge. Yathaidhaamsi samiddhognir bhasmasaat kuruterjuna; Jnaanaagnih sarvakarmaani bhasmasaat kurute tathaa. . As the blazing fire reduces fuel to ashes, O Arjuna, so does the fire of knowledge reduce all actions to ashes! Na hi jnaanena sadrisham pavitram iha vidyate; Tat swayam yogasamsiddhah kaalenaatmani vindati. . Verily there is no purifier in this world like knowledge. He who is perfected in Yoga finds it in the Self in time. Shraddhaavaan labhate jnaanam tatparah samyatendriyah; Jnaanam labdhvaa paraam shaantim achirenaadhigacchati. . The man who is full of faith, who is devoted to it, and who has subdued all the senses, obtains this knowledge; and, having obtained the knowledge, he goes at once to the supreme peace. Ajnashchaashraddhadhaanashcha samshayaatmaa vinashyati; Naayam lokosti na paro na sukham samshayaatmanah. . The ignorant, the faithless, the doubting self proceeds to destruction; there is neither this world nor the other nor happiness for the doubting. Yogasannyasta karmaanam jnaanasamcchinnasamshayam; Aatmavantam na karmaani nibadhnanti dhananjaya. . He who has renounced actions by Yoga, whose doubts are rent asunder by knowledge, and who is self-possessed,actions do not bind him, O Arjuna! Tasmaad ajnaanasambhootam hritstham jnaanaasinaatmanah; Cchittwainam samshayam yogam aatishthottishtha bhaarata. . Therefore, with the sword of knowledge of the Self cut asunder the doubt of the self born of ignorance, residing in thy heart, and take refuge in Yoga; arise, O Arjuna! Hari Om Tat Sat Iti Srimad Bhagavadgeetaasoopanishatsu Brahmavidyaayaam Yogashaastre Sri Krishnaarjunasamvaade Jnaanavibhaagayogo Naama Chaturthodhyaayah Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita, the science of the Eternal, the scripture of Yoga, the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna, ends the fourth discourse entitled: The Yoga of Wisdom V The Yoga of Renunciation of Action Summary of Fifth Discourse In spite of Sri Krishnas clear instructions, Arjuna still seems to be bewildered. He wants to know conclusively which is superior, the path of action or the path of renunciation of action. The Lord says that both the paths lead to the highest goal of God-realisation. In both cases the final realisation of the Atman is the aim, but the path of Karma Yoga is superior. Actually there is no real difference between the two. Krishna further asserts that perfection can be attained and one can be established in the Atman only after the mind has been purified through the performance of selfless action. The Karma Yogi who is aware of the Atman and who is constantly engaged in action knows that although the intellect, mind and senses are active, he does not do anything. He is a spectator of everything. He dedicates all his actions to the Lord and thus abandons attachment, ever remaining pure and unaffected. He surrenders himself completely to the Divine Shakti. Having completely rooted out all desires, attachments and the ego, he is not born again. The sage who has realised Brahman and is always absorbed in It does not have any rebirth. Such a sage sees Brahman within and withoutwithin as the static and transcendent Brahman, and without as the entire universe. He sees the one Self in all beings and creaturesin a cow, an elephant, and even in a dog and an outcaste. He is ever free from joy and grief and enjoys eternal peace and happiness. He does not depend upon the senses for his satisfaction. On the other hand the enjoyments of the senses are generators of pain. They are impermanent. Sri Krishna reminds Arjuna that desire is the main cause of pain and suffering. It is the cause of anger. Therefore, the aspirant should try to eradicate desire and anger if he is to reach the Supreme. The Lord concludes by describing how to control the senses, mind and intellect by concentrating between the eyebrows and practising Pranayama. One who has achieved perfect control of the outgoing senses and is freed from desire, anger and fear attains liberation and enjoys perfect peace. Arjuna Uvaacha: Sannyaasam karmanaam krishna punar yogam cha shamsasi; Yacchreya etayorekam tanme broohi sunishchitam. Arjuna said: . Renunciation of actions, O Krishna, Thou praisest, and again Yoga! Tell me conclusively which is the better of the two. Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha: Sannyaasah karmayogashcha nihshreyasakaraa vubhau; Tayostu karmasannyaasaat karmayogo vishishyate. The Blessed Lord said: . Renunciation and the Yoga of action both lead to the highest bliss; but of the two, the Yoga of action is superior to the renunciation of action. Jneyah sa nityasannyaasi yo na dweshti na kaangkshati; Nirdwandwo hi mahaabaaho sukham bandhaat pramuchyate. . He should be known as a perpetual Sannyasin who neither hates nor desires; for, free from the pairs of opposites, O mighty-armed Arjuna, he is easily set free from bondage! COMMENTARY: A man does not become a Sannyasin by merely giving up actions due to laziness, ignorance, some family quarrel or calamity or unemployment. A true Sannyasin is one who has neither attachment nor aversion to anything. Physical renunciation of objects is no renunciation at all. What is wanted is the renunciation of egoism and desires. Saankhyayogau prithagbaalaah pravadanti na panditaah; Ekam apyaasthitah samyag ubhayor vindate phalam. . Children, not the wise, speak of knowledge and the Yoga of action or the performance of action as though they are distinct and different; he who is truly established in one obtains the fruits of both. Yatsaankhyaih praapyate sthaanam tad yogair api gamyate; Ekam saankhyam cha yogam cha yah pashyati sa pashyati. . That place which is reached by the Sankhyas or the Jnanis is reached by the Karma Yogis. He sees who sees knowledge and the performance of action Karma Yoga as one. Sannyaasastu mahaabaaho duhkham aaptuma yogatah; Yogayukto munir brahma na chirenaadhigacchati. . But renunciation, O mighty-armed Arjuna, is hard to attain without Yoga; the Yoga-harmonised sage proceeds quickly to Brahman! Yogayukto vishuddhaatmaa vijitaatmaa jitendriyah; Sarvabhootaatmabhootaatmaa kurvannapi na lipyate. . He who is devoted to the path of action, whose mind is quite pure, who has conquered the self, who has subdued his senses and who has realised his Self as the Self in all beings, though acting, he is not tainted. Naiva kinchit karomeeti yukto manyeta tattwavit; Pashyan shrunvan sprishan jighran nashnan gacchan swapan shwasan. . I do nothing at allthus will the harmonised knower of Truth thinkseeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, going, sleeping, breathing, Pralapan visrijan grihnan nunmishan nimishannapi; Indriyaaneendriyaartheshu vartanta iti dhaarayan. . Speaking, letting go, seizing, opening and closing the eyesconvinced that the senses move among the sense-objects. COMMENTARY: The liberated sage always remains as a witness of the activities of the senses as he identifies himself with the Self. Brahmanyaadhaaya karmaani sangam tyaktwaa karoti yah; Lipyate na sa paapena padmapatram ivaambhasaa. . He who performs actions, offering them to Brahman and abandoning attachment, is not tainted by sin as a lotus leaf by water. Kaayena manasaa buddhyaa kevalair indriyair api; Yoginah karma kurvanti sangam tyaktwaatmashuddhaye. . Yogis, having abandoned attachment, perform actions only by the body, mind, intellect and also by the senses, for the purification of the self. Yuktah karmaphalam tyaktwaa shaantim aapnoti naishthikeem; Ayuktah kaamakaarena phale sakto nibadhyate. . The united one the well poised or the harmonised, having abandoned the fruit of action, attains to the eternal peace; the non-united only the unsteady or the unbalanced, impelled by desire and attached to the fruit, is bound. Sarvakarmaani manasaa sannyasyaaste sukham vashee; Navadwaare pure dehee naiva kurvan na kaarayan. . Mentally renouncing all actions and self-controlled, the embodied one rests happily in the nine-gated city, neither acting nor causing others body and senses to act. Na kartritwam na karmaani lokasya srijati prabhuh; Na karmaphala samyogam swabhaavas tu pravartate. . Neither agency nor actions does the Lord create for the world, nor union with the fruits of actions; it is Nature that acts. Naadatte kasyachit paapam na chaiva sukritam vibhuh; Ajnaanenaavritam jnaanam tena muhyanti jantavah. . The Lord accepts neither the demerit nor even the merit of any; knowledge is enveloped by ignorance, thereby beings are deluded. Jnaanena tu tad ajnaanam yeshaam naashitam aatmanah; Teshaam aadityavaj jnaanam prakaashayati tatparam. . But, to those whose ignorance is destroyed by knowledge of the Self, like the sun, knowledge reveals the Supreme Brahman. Tadbuddhayas tadaatmaanas tannishthaas tatparaayanaah; Gacchantyapunaraavrittim jnaana nirdhoota kalmashaah. . Their intellect absorbed in That, their self being That; established in That, with That as their supreme goal, they go whence there is no return, their sins dispelled by knowledge. Vidyaavinaya sampanne braahmane gavi hastini; Shuni chaiva shvapaake cha panditaah samadarshinah. . Sages look with an equal eye on a Brahmin endowed with learning and humility, on a cow, on an elephant, and even on a dog and an outcaste. Ihaiva tairjitah sargo yeshaam saamye sthitam manah; Nirdosham hi samam brahma tasmaad brahmani te sthitaah. . Even here in this world birth everything is overcome by those whose minds rest in equality; Brahman is spotless indeed and equal; therefore, they are established in Brahman. Na prahrishyet priyam praapya nodwijet praapya chaapriyam; Sthirabuddhir asammoodho brahmavid brahmani sthitah. . Resting in Brahman, with steady intellect, undeluded, the knower of Brahman neither rejoiceth on obtaining what is pleasant nor grieveth on obtaining what is unpleasant. Baahyasparsheshwasaktaatmaa vindatyaatmani yat sukham; Sa brahma yoga yuktaatmaa sukham akshayam ashnute. . With the self unattached to the external contacts he discovers happiness in the Self; with the self engaged in the meditation of Brahman he attains to the endless happiness. Ye hi samsparshajaa bhogaa duhkhayonaya eva te; Aadyantavantah kaunteya na teshu ramate budhah. . The enjoyments that are born of contacts are generators of pain only, for they have a beginning and an end, O Arjuna! The wise do not rejoice in them. Shaknoteehaiva yah sodhum praak shareera vimokshanaat; Kaamakrodhodbhavam vegam sa yuktah sa sukhee narah. . He who is able, while still here in this world to withstand, before the liberation from the body, the impulse born of desire and angerhe is a Yogi, he is a happy man. Yontah sukhontaraaraamas tathaantarjyotir eva yah; Sa yogee brahma nirvaanam brahmabhootodhigacchati. . He who is ever happy within, who rejoices within, who is illumined within, such a Yogi attains absolute freedom or Moksha, himself becoming Brahman. Labhante brahma nirvaanam rishayah ksheenakalmashaah; Cchinnadwaidhaa yataatmaanah sarvabhootahite rataah. . The sages obtain absolute freedom or Mokshathey whose sins have been destroyed, whose dualities perception of dualities or experience of the pairs of opposites are torn asunder, who are self-controlled, and intent on the welfare of all beings. Kaamakrodhaviyuktaanaam yateenaam yatachetasaam; Abhito brahma nirvaanam vartate viditaatmanaam. . Absolute freedom or Brahmic bliss exists on all sides for those self-controlled ascetics who are free from desire and anger, who have controlled their thoughts and who have realised the Self. Sparsaan kritwaa bahir baahyaamschakshus chaivaantare bhruvoh; Praanaapaanau samau kritwaa naasaabhyantara chaarinau. . Shutting out all external contacts and fixing the gaze between the eyebrows, equalising the outgoing and incoming breaths moving within the nostrils, Yatendriya manobuddhir munir mokshaparaayanah; Vigatecchaabhaya krodho yah sadaa mukta eva sah. . With the senses, the mind and the intellect always controlled, having liberation as his supreme goal, free from desire, fear and angerthe sage is verily liberated for ever. Bhoktaaram yajnatapasaam sarvaloka maheshwaram; Suhridam sarvabhootaanaam jnaatwaa maam shaantim ricchati. . He who knows Me as the enjoyer of sacrifices and austerities, the great Lord of all the worlds and the friend of all beings, attains to peace. Hari Om Tat Sat Iti Srimad Bhagavadgeetaasoopanishatsu Brahmavidyaayaam Yogashaastre Sri Krishnaarjunasamvaade Karmasanyaasayogo Naama Panchamodhyaayah Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita, the science of the Eternal, the scripture of Yoga, the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna ends the fifth discourse entitled: The Yoga of Renunciation of Action VI The Yoga of Meditation Summary of Sixth Discourse Sri Krishna emphasises once again that the Yogi or Sannyasin is one who has renounced the fruits of actions, not the actions themselves. The performance of actions without an eye on their fruits brings about the purification of the mind. Only a purified mind, a mind free from desires, can engage itself in constant meditation on the Atman. Desire gives rise to imagination or Sankalpa, which drives the soul into the field of action. Therefore, none can realise permanent freedom and tranquillity of mind without renouncing desires. The lower self must be controlled by the higher Self. All the lower impulses of the body, mind and senses must be controlled by the power of the higher Self. Then the higher Self becomes ones friend. He who has perfect control of the body, mind and senses and is united with God, sees God in all objects and beings. He sees inwardly that there is no difference between gold and stone, between friends and enemies, between the righteous and the unrighteous. He is perfectly harmonised. Sri Krishna proceeds to give various practical hints as to the practice of meditation. The aspirant should select a secluded spot where there is no likelihood of disturbance. He should arrange his meditation seat properly and sit in a comfortable posture, with the head, neck and spine erect but not tensed. He should fix his purified mind on the Atman by concentrating between the eyebrows or on the tip of the nose. The practice of Brahmacharya is absolutely necessary if one is to succeed in meditation. The conservation and transformation of the vital fluid into spiritual energy gives immense power of concentration. Fearlessness, too, is an essential quality on the Godward path. It is faith in the sustaining protection and Grace of God. The aspirant is advised to practise moderation in his daily habitsin eating, sleeping, recreation, etc. Extremes are to be avoided as they hinder the practice of meditation. Living a life of such moderation, and gathering up all his forces and directing them towards meditation upon the Atman, the aspirant gradually transcends the senses and intellect and merges himself in the blissful Atman. He finds that the bliss of the Atman is incomparable, that there is no gain greater than the Self. Having thus attained perfect union with the Self, the Yogi no more descends into ignorance or delusion. He does not relish any more the pleasures of the senses. Lord Krishna again emphasises that the concentration of the mind on the Atman should be like a steady flame in a windless place. This ultimately leads to the vision of the Lord in all beings and creatures. Arjuna is doubtful whether it is at all possible to engage the mind steadily on the higher Self, as its very nature seems to be one of restlessness. Krishna assures him that the practice can succeed through Vairagya dispassion and constant effort. Arjuna wishes to know the fate of the aspirant who fails to realise the Supreme in spite of his faith and sincerity. Krishna tells him that the accumulated power of his Yogic practices will assure him a better birth in the future, with more favourable conditions for Sadhana. The aspirant will then be compelled to carry on his Yogic practices with greater vigour and faith and will finally achieve God-realisation. Krishna concludes that the Yogione who has attained union with the Supreme Lordis superior to the ascetics, to the men of book knowledge and the men of action, as the latter have not transcended ignorance and merged in the Self. Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha: Anaashritah karmaphalam kaaryam karma karoti yah; Sa sannyaasi cha yogee cha na niragnirna chaakriyah. The Blessed Lord said: . He who performs his bounden duty without depending on the fruits of his actionshe is a Sannyasin and a Yogi, not he who is without fire and without action. Yam sannyaasamiti praahuryogam tam viddhi paandava; Na hyasannyastasankalpo yogee bhavati kashchana. . Do thou, O Arjuna, know Yoga to be that which they call renunciation; no one verily becomes a Yogi who has not renounced thoughts! COMMENTARY: Lord Krishna eulogises Karma Yoga here because it is a means or a stepping stone to the Yoga of meditation. In order to encourage the practice of Karma Yoga it is stated here that it is Sannyasa. Aarurukshormuneryogam karma kaaranamuchyate; Yogaaroodhasya tasyaiva shamah kaaranamuchyate. . For a sage who wishes to attain to Yoga, action is said to be the means; for the same sage who has attained to Yoga, inaction quiescence is said to be the means. Yadaa hi nendriyaartheshu na karmaswanushajjate; Sarvasankalpasannyaasee yogaaroodhas tadochyate. . When a man is not attached to the sense-objects or to actions, having renounced all thoughts, then he is said to have attained to Yoga. Uddharedaatmanaatmaanam naatmaanamavasaadayet; Atmaiva hyaatmano bandhuraatmaiva ripuraatmanah. . Let a man lift himself by his own Self alone; let him not lower himself, for this self alone is the friend of oneself and this self alone is the enemy of oneself. Bandhuraatmaatmanastasya yenaatmaivaatmanaa jitah; Anaatmanastu shatrutwe vartetaatmaiva shatruvat. . The self is the friend of the self for him who has conquered himself by the Self, but to the unconquered self, this self stands in the position of an enemy like the external foe. Jitaatmanah prashaantasya paramaatmaa samaahitah; Sheetoshna sukha duhkheshu tathaa maanaapamaanayoh. . The Supreme Self of him who is self-controlled and peaceful is balanced in cold and heat, pleasure and pain, as also in honour and dishonour. Jnaana vijnaana triptaatmaa kootastho vijitendriyah; Yuktah ityuchyate yogee samaloshtaashmakaanchanah. . The Yogi who is satisfied with the knowledge and the wisdom of the Self, who has conquered the senses, and to whom a clod of earth, a piece of stone and gold are the same, is said to be harmonised that is, is said to have attained the state of Nirvikalpa Samadhi. Suhrinmitraary udaaseena madhyastha dweshya bandhushu; Saadhushwapi cha paapeshu samabuddhirvishishyate. . He who is of the same mind to the good-hearted, friends, enemies, the indifferent, the neutral, the hateful, the relatives, the righteous and the unrighteous, excels. Yogee yunjeeta satatamaatmaanam rahasi sthitah; Ekaakee yatachittaatmaa niraasheeraparigrahah. . Let the Yogi try constantly to keep the mind steady, remaining in solitude, alone, with the mind and the body controlled, and free from hope and greed. Shuchau deshe pratishthaapya sthiramaasanamaatmanah; Naatyucchritam naatineecham chailaajinakushottaram. . In a clean spot, having established a firm seat of his own, neither too high nor too low, made of a cloth, a skin and kusha grass, one over the other, Tatraikaagram manah kritwaa yatachittendriyakriyah; Upavishyaasane yunjyaadyogamaatmavishuddhaye. . There, having made the mind one-pointed, with the actions of the mind and the senses controlled, let him, seated on the seat, practise Yoga for the purification of the self. Samam kaayashirogreevam dhaarayannachalam sthirah; Samprekshya naasikaagram swam dishashchaanavalokayan. . Let him firmly hold his body, head and neck erect and perfectly still, gazing at the tip of his nose, without looking around. Prashaantaatmaa vigatabheer brahmachaarivrate sthitah; Manah samyamya macchitto yukta aaseeta matparah. . Serene-minded, fearless, firm in the vow of a Brahmachari, having controlled the mind, thinking of Me and balanced in mind, let him sit, having Me as his supreme goal. Yunjannevam sadaatmaanam yogee niyatamaanasah; Shaantim nirvaanaparamaam matsamsthaamadhigacchati. . Thus, always keeping the mind balanced, the Yogi, with the mind controlled, attains to the peace abiding in Me, which culminates in liberation. Naatyashnatastu yogosti nachaikaantamanashnatah; Na chaatiswapnasheelasya jaagrato naiva chaarjuna. . Verily Yoga is not possible for him who eats too much, nor for him who does not eat at all; nor for him who sleeps too much, nor for him who is always awake, O Arjuna! Yuktaahaaravihaarasya yuktacheshtasya karmasu; Yuktaswapnaavabodhasya yogo bhavati duhkhahaa. . Yoga becomes the destroyer of pain for him who is always moderate in eating and recreation such as walking, etc., who is moderate in exertion in actions, who is moderate in sleep and wakefulness. Yadaa viniyatam chittamaatmanyevaavatishthate; Nihsprihah sarvakaamebhyo yukta ityuchyate tadaa. . When the perfectly controlled mind rests in the Self only, free from longing for the objects of desire, then it is said: He is united. COMMENTARY: Without union with the Self neither harmony nor balance nor Samadhi is possible. Yathaa deepo nivaatastho nengate sopamaa smritaa; Yogino yatachittasya yunjato yogamaatmanah. . As a lamp placed in a windless spot does not flickerto such is compared the Yogi of controlled mind, practising Yoga in the Self or absorbed in the Yoga of the Self. COMMENTARY: This is a beautiful simile which Yogis often quote when they talk of concentration or one-pointedness of mind. Yatroparamate chittam niruddham yogasevayaa; Yatra chaivaatmanaatmaanam pashyannaatmani tushyati. . When the mind, restrained by the practice of Yoga, attains to quietude, and when, seeing the Self by the Self, he is satisfied in his own Self, Sukhamaatyantikam yattad buddhi graahyamateendriyam; Vetti yatra na chaivaayam sthitashchalati tattwatah. . When he the Yogi feels that infinite bliss which can be grasped by the pure intellect and which transcends the senses, and, established wherein he never moves from the Reality, Yam labdhwaa chaaparam laabham manyate naadhikam tatah; Yasmin sthito na duhkhena gurunaapi vichaalyate. . Which, having obtained, he thinks there is no other gain superior to it; wherein established, he is not moved even by heavy sorrow, Tam vidyaad duhkhasamyogaviyogam yogasamjnitam; Sa nishchayena yoktavyo yogonirvinna chetasaa. . Let that be known by the name of Yoga, the severance from union with pain. This Yoga should be practised with determination and with an undesponding mind. Sankalpaprabhavaan kaamaan styaktwaa sarvaan asheshatah; Manasaivendriyagraamam viniyamya samantatah. . Abandoning without reserve all the desires born of Sankalpa, and completely restraining the whole group of senses by the mind from all sides, COMMENTARY: The mind is so diplomatic that it keeps certain desires for its secret gratification. So one should completely abandon all desires without reservation. Shanaih shanairuparamed buddhyaa dhritigriheetayaa; Aatmasamstham manah kritwaa na kinchidapi chintayet. . Little by little let him attain to quietude by the intellect held firmly; having made the mind establish itself in the Self, let him not think of anything. Yato yato nishcharati manashchanchalamasthiram; Tatastato niyamyaitad aatmanyeva vasham nayet. . From whatever cause the restless, unsteady mind wanders away, from that let him restrain it and bring it under the control of the Self alone. Prashaantamanasam hyenam yoginam sukhamuttamam; Upaiti shaantarajasam brahmabhootamakalmasham. . Supreme bliss verily comes to this Yogi whose mind is quite peaceful, whose passion is quieted, who has become Brahman, and who is free from sin. Yunjannevam sadaatmaanam yogee vigatakalmashah; Sukhena brahmasamsparsham atyantam sukham ashnute. . The Yogi, always engaging the mind thus in the practice of Yoga, freed from sins, easily enjoys the infinite bliss of contact with Brahman the Eternal. Sarvabhootasthamaatmaanam sarvabhootaani chaatmani; Eekshate yogayuktaatmaa sarvatra samadarshanah. . With the mind harmonised by Yoga he sees the Self abiding in all beings and all beings in the Self; he sees the same everywhere. Yo maam pashyati sarvatra sarvam cha mayi pashyati; Tasyaaham na pranashyaami sa cha me na pranashyati. . He who sees Me everywhere and sees everything in Me, he does not become separated from Me nor do I become separated from him. COMMENTARY: The Lord describes here the effect of oneness. Sarvabhootasthitam yo maam bhajatyekatwamaasthitah; Sarvathaa vartamaanopi sa yogee mayi vartate. . He who, being established in unity, worships Me who dwells in all beings,that Yogi abides in Me, whatever may be his mode of living. Aatmaupamyena sarvatra samam pashyati yorjuna; Sukham vaa yadi vaa duhkham sa yogee paramo matah. . He who, through the likeness of the Self, O Arjuna, sees equality everywhere, be it pleasure or pain, he is regarded as the highest Yogi! Arjuna Uvaacha: Yoyam yogastwayaa proktah saamyena madhusoodana; Etasyaaham na pashyaami chanchalatwaat sthitim sthiraam. Arjuna said: . This Yoga of equanimity taught by Thee, O Krishna, I do not see its steady continuance, because of restlessness of the mind! Chanchalam hi manah krishna pramaathi balavad dridham; Tasyaaham nigraham manye vaayoriva sudushkaram. . The mind verily is restless, turbulent, strong and unyielding, O Krishna! I deem it as difficult to control as to control the wind. COMMENTARY: The mind ever changes its point of concentration from one object to another. So it is always restless. It is not only restless but also turbulent and impetuous, strong and obstinate. It produces agitation in the body and in the senses. That is why the mind is even more difficult to control than to control the wind. Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha: Asamshayam mahaabaaho mano durnigraham chalam; Abhyaasena tu kaunteya vairaagyena cha grihyate. The Blessed Lord said: . Undoubtedly, O mighty-armed Arjuna, the mind is difficult to control and restless; but, by practice and by dispassion it may be restrained! Asamyataatmanaa yogo dushpraapa iti me matih; Vashyaatmanaa tu yatataa shakyovaaptumupaayatah. . I think that Yoga is hard to be attained by one of uncontrolled self, but the selfcontrolled and striving one attains to it by the proper means. Arjuna Uvaacha: Ayatih shraddhayopeto yogaacchalitamaanasah; Apraapya yogasamsiddhim kaam gatim krishna gacchati. Arjuna said: . He who is unable to control himself though he has the faith, and whose mind wanders away from Yoga, what end does he meet, having failed to attain perfection in Yoga, O Krishna? Kacchinnobhayavibhrashtash cchinnaabhramiva nashyati; Apratishtho mahaabaaho vimoodho brahmanah pathi. . Fallen from both, does he not perish like a rent cloud, supportless, O mighty-armed Krishna, deluded on the path of Brahman? Etanme samshayam krishna cchettumarhasyasheshatah; Twadanyah samshayasyaasya cchettaa na hyupapadyate. . This doubt of mine, O Krishna, do Thou completely dispel, because it is not possible for any but Thee to dispel this doubt. COMMENTARY: There is no better teacher than the Lord Himself as He is omniscient. Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha: Paartha naiveha naamutra vinaashas tasya vidyate; Nahi kalyaanakrit kashchid durgatim taata gacchati. The Blessed Lord said: . O Arjuna, neither in this world, nor in the next world is there destruction for him; none, verily, who does good, O My son, ever comes to grief! Praapya punyakritaam lokaanushitwaa shaashwateeh samaah; Shucheenaam shreemataam gehe yogabhrashtobhijaayate. . Having attained to the worlds of the righteous and, having dwelt there for everlasting years, he who fell from Yoga is reborn in the house of the pure and wealthy. Athavaa yoginaameva kule bhavati dheemataam; Etaddhi durlabhataram loke janma yadeedrisham. . Or he is born in a family of even the wise Yogis; verily a birth like this is very difficult to obtain in this world. Tatra tam buddhisamyogam labhate paurvadehikam; Yatate cha tato bhooyah samsiddhau kurunandana. . There he comes in touch with the knowledge acquired in his former body and strives more than before for perfection, O Arjuna! Poorvaabhyaasena tenaiva hriyate hyavashopi sah; Jijnaasurapi yogasya shabdabrahmaativartate. . By that very former practice he is borne on in spite of himself. Even he who merely wishes to know Yoga transcends the Brahmic word. COMMENTARY: One who had fallen from Yoga is carried to the goal which he intended to reach in his previous birth, by the force of the impressions of his past Yogic practices, though he may be unconscious of it and may not be willing to adopt the course of Yogic discipline due to the force of some evil Karma. Prayatnaadyatamaanastu yogee samshuddhakilbishah; Anekajanmasamsiddhas tato yaati paraam gatim. . But, the Yogi who strives with assiduity, purified of sins and perfected gradually through many births, reaches the highest goal. Tapaswibhyodhiko yogee jnaanibhyopi matodhikah; Karmibhyashchaadhiko yogee tasmaad yogee bhavaarjuna. . The Yogi is thought to be superior to the ascetics and even superior to men of knowledge obtained through the study of scriptures; he is also superior to men of action; therefore, be thou a Yogi, O Arjuna! Yoginaamapi sarveshaam madgatenaantaraatmanaa; Shraddhaavaan bhajate yo maam sa me yuktatamo matah. . And among all the Yogis, he who, full of faith and with his inner self merged in Me, worships Me, he is deemed by Me to be the most devout. Hari Om Tat Sat Iti Srimad Bhagavadgeetaasoopanishatsu Brahmavidyaayaam Yogashaastre Sri Krishnaarjunasamvaade Aatmasamyamayogo Naama Shashthodhyaayah Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita, the science of the Eternal, the scripture of Yoga, the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna, ends the sixth discourse entitled: The Yoga of Meditation VII The Yoga of Wisdom and Realisation Summary of Seventh Discourse Sri Krishna tells Arjuna that the supreme Godhead has to be realised in both its transcendent and immanent aspects. The Yogi who has reached this summit has nothing more to know. This complete union with the Lord is difficult of attainment. Among many thousands of human beings, very few aspire for this union, and even among those who aspire for it, few ever reach the pinnacle of spiritual realisation. The Lord has already given a clear description of the all-pervading static and infinite state of His. Now He proceeds to explain His manifestations as the universe and the power behind it. He speaks of these manifestations as His lower and higher Prakritis. The lower Prakriti is made up of the five elements, mind, ego and intellect. The higher Prakriti is the life-element which upholds the universe, activates it and causes its appearance and final dissolution. Krishna says that whatever exists is nothing but Himself. He is the cause of the appearance of the universe and all things in it. Everything is strung on Him like clusters of gems on a string. He is the essence, substance and substratum of everything, whether visible or invisible. Although everything is in Him, yet He transcends everything as the actionless Self. Prakriti or Nature is made up of the three Gunas or qualitiesSattwa, Rajas and Tamas. These three qualities delude the soul and make it forget its true nature, which is one with God. This delusion, termed Maya, can only be removed by the Grace of the Lord Himself. Thus far Arjuna has been taught the highest form of devotion, which leads to union with God in His static aspect as also with His dynamic Prakriti. Krishna tells him that there are also other forms of devotion which are inferior as they are performed with various motives. The distressed, the seeker of divine wisdom, and he who desires wealth, worship Him, as also the wise. Of these the Lord deems the wise as dearest to Him. Such a devotee loves the Lord for the sake of pure love alone. Whatever form the devotee worships, the ultimate goal is the Lord Himself. The Lord accepts such worship, knowing that it is directed to Him only. Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha: Mayyaasaktamanaah paartha yogam yunjanmadaashrayah; Asamshayam samagram maam yathaa jnaasyasi tacchrinu. The Blessed Lord said: . O Arjuna, hear how you shall without doubt know Me fully, with the mind intent on Me, practising Yoga and taking refuge in Me! COMMENTARY: If you sing the glories and attributes of the Lord, you will develop love for Him and then your mind will be ever fixed on Him. Intense love for the Lord is real devotion. With this you must surely get full knowledge of the Self. Jnaanam teham savijnaanam idam vakshyaamyasheshatah; Yajjnaatwaa neha bhooyonyaj jnaatavyamavashishyate. . I shall declare to thee in full this knowledge combined with direct realisation, after knowing which nothing more here remains to be known. Manushyaanaam sahasreshu kashchidyatati siddhaye; Yatataamapi siddhaanaam kashchinmaam vetti tattwatah. . Among thousands of men, one perchance strives for perfection; even among those successful strivers, only one perchance knows Me in essence. Bhoomiraaponalo vaayuh kham mano buddhireva cha; Ahamkaara iteeyam me bhinnaa prakritirashtadhaa. . Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intellect and egoismthus is My Nature divided eightfold. Apareyamitastwanyaam prakritim viddhi me paraam; Jeevabhootaam mahaabaaho yayedam dhaaryate jagat. . This is the inferior Prakriti, O mighty-armed Arjuna! Know thou as different from it My higher Prakriti Nature, the very life-element by which this world is upheld. Etadyoneeni bhootaani sarvaaneetyupadhaaraya; Aham kritsnasya jagatah prabhavah pralayastathaa. . Know that these two My higher and lower Natures are the womb of all beings. So, I am the source and dissolution of the whole universe. Mattah parataram naanyat kinchidasti dhananjaya; Mayi sarvamidam protam sootre maniganaa iva. . There is nothing whatsoever higher than Me, O Arjuna! All this is strung on Me as clusters of gems on a string. COMMENTARY: There is no other cause of the universe but Me. I alone am the cause of the universe. Rasohamapsu kaunteya prabhaasmi shashisooryayoh; Pranavah sarvavedeshu shabdah khe paurusham nrishu. . I am the sapidity in water, O Arjuna! I am the light in the moon and the sun; I am the syllable Om in all the Vedas, sound in ether, and virility in men. Punyo gandhah prithivyaam cha tejashchaasmi vibhaavasau; Jeevanam sarvabhooteshu tapashchaasmi tapaswishu. . I am the sweet fragrance in earth and the brilliance in fire, the life in all beings; and I am austerity in ascetics. Beejam maam sarvabhootaanaam viddhi paartha sanaatanam; Buddhir buddhimataamasmi tejastejaswinaamaham. . Know Me, O Arjuna, as the eternal seed of all beings; I am the intelligence of the intelligent; the splendour of the splendid objects am I! Balam balavataam asmi kaamaraagavivarjitam; Dharmaaviruddho bhooteshu kaamosmi bharatarshabha. . Of the strong, I am the strength devoid of desire and attachment, and in all beings, I am the desire unopposed to Dharma, O Arjuna! Ye chaiva saattvikaa bhaavaa raajasaastaamasaashcha ye; Matta eveti taanviddhi na twaham teshu te mayi. . Whatever being and objects that are pure, active and inert, know that they proceed from Me. They are in Me, yet I am not in them. Tribhirgunamayair bhaavairebhih sarvamidam jagat; Mohitam naabhijaanaati maamebhyah paramavyayam. . Deluded by these Natures states or things composed of the three qualities of Nature, all this world does not know Me as distinct from them and immutable. Daivee hyeshaa gunamayee mama maayaa duratyayaa; Maameva ye prapadyante maayaametaam taranti te. . Verily this divine illusion of Mine made up of the qualities of Nature is difficult to cross over; those who take refuge in Me alone cross over this illusion. Na maam dushkritino moodhaah prapadyante naraadhamaah; Maayayaapahritajnaanaa aasuram bhaavamaashritaah. . The evil-doers and the deluded, who are the lowest of men, do not seek Me; they whose knowledge is destroyed by illusion follow the ways of demons. Chaturvidhaa bhajante maam janaah sukritinorjuna; Aarto jijnaasurartharthee jnaanee cha bharatarshabha. . Four kinds of virtuous men worship Me, O Arjuna! They are the distressed, the seeker of knowledge, the seeker of wealth, and the wise, O lord of the Bharatas! Teshaam jnaanee nityayukta eka bhaktirvishishyate; Priyo hi jnaaninotyarthamaham sa cha mama priyah. . Of them, the wise, ever steadfast and devoted to the One, excels is the best; for, I am exceedingly dear to the wise and he is dear to Me. Udaaraah sarva evaite jnaanee twaatmaiva me matam; Aasthitah sa hi yuktaatmaa maamevaanuttamaam gatim. . Noble indeed are all these; but I deem the wise man as My very Self; for, steadfast in mind, he is established in Me alone as the supreme goal. Bahoonaam janmanaamante jnaanavaanmaam prapadyate; Vaasudevah sarvamiti sa mahaatmaa sudurlabhah. . At the end of many births the wise man comes to Me, realising that all this is Vasudeva the innermost Self; such a great soul Mahatma is very hard to find. Kaamaistaistairhritajnaanaah prapadyantenyadevataah; Tam tam niyamamaasthaaya prakrityaa niyataah swayaa. . Those whose wisdom has been rent away by this or that desire, go to other gods, following this or that rite, led by their own nature. Yo yo yaam yaam tanum bhaktah shraddhayaarchitum icchati; Tasya tasyaachalaam shraddhaam taameva vidadhaamyaham. . Whatsoever form any devotee desires to worship with faiththat same faith of his I make firm and unflinching. Sa tayaa shraddhayaa yuktastasyaaraadhanameehate; Labhate cha tatah kaamaan mayaiva vihitaan hi taan. . Endowed with that faith, he engages in the worship of that form, and from it he obtains his desire, these being verily ordained by Me alone. Antavattu phalam teshaam tadbhavatyalpamedhasaam; Devaan devayajo yaanti madbhaktaa yaanti maamapi. . Verily the reward fruit that accrues to those men of small intelligence is finite. The worshippers of the gods go to them, but My devotees come to Me. Avyaktam vyaktimaapannam manyante maamabuddhayah; Param bhaavamajaananto mamaavyayamanuttamam. . The foolish think of Me, the Unmanifest, as having manifestation, knowing not My higher, immutable and most excellent nature. Naaham prakaashah sarvasya yogamaayaasamaavritah; Moodhoyam naabhijaanaati loko maamajamavyayam. . I am not manifest to all as I am, being veiled by the Yoga Maya. This deluded world does not know Me, the unborn and imperishable. Vedaaham samateetaani vartamaanaani chaarjuna; Bhavishyaani cha bhootani maam tu veda na kashchana. . I know, O Arjuna, the beings of the past, the present and the future, but no one knows Me. Icchaadweshasamutthena dwandwamohena bhaarata; Sarvabhootaani sammoham sarge yaanti parantapa. . By the delusion of the pairs of opposites arising from desire and aversion, O Bharata, all beings are subject to delusion at birth, O Parantapa! Yeshaam twantagatam paapam janaanaam punyakarmanaam; Te dwandwamohanirmuktaa bhajante maam dridhavrataah. . But those men of virtuous deeds whose sins have come to an end, and who are freed from the delusion of the pairs of opposites, worship Me, steadfast in their vows. Jaraamaranamokshaaya maamaashritya yatanti ye; Te brahma tadviduh kritsnam adhyaatmam karma chaakhilam. . Those who strive for liberation from old age and death, taking refuge in Me, realise in full that Brahman, the whole knowledge of the Self and all action. Saadhibhootaadhidaivam maam saadhiyajnam cha ye viduh; Prayaanakaalepi cha maam te vidur yuktachetasah. . Those who know Me with the Adhibhuta pertaining to the elements, the Adhidaiva pertaining to the gods, and Adhiyajna pertaining to the sacrifice, know Me even at the time of death, steadfast in mind. COMMENTARY: They who are steadfast in mind, who have taken refuge in Me, who know Me as knowledge of elements on the physical plane, as knowledge of gods on the celestial or mental plane, as knowledge of sacrifice in the realm of sacrifice,they are not affected by death. Hari Om Tat Sat Iti Srimad Bhagavadgeetaasoopanishatsu Brahmavidyaayaam Yogashaastre Sri Krishnaarjunasamvaade Jnaanavijnaanayogo Naama Saptamodhyaayah Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita, the science of the Eternal, the scripture of Yoga, the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna, ends the seventh discourse entitled: The Yoga of Wisdom and Realisation VIII The Yoga of the Imperishable Brahman Summary of Eighth Discourse Lord Krishna explains how those who attain Him do not have to come again into this impermanent world of sorrow and pain. All beings, including even the gods, come again and again into this created universe from the state of unmanifest being wherein they remained at the end of an age-cycle. But the Lord exists even beyond this unmanifest being. That radiant, imperishable Divine Reality is the highest goal to be attained. Single-minded devotion of our heart is the means of attaining this highest blessed state. Even though there are auspicious and inauspicious circumstances of departing from the physical body and journeying forth, yet if one steadily abides in the Lord through firm devotion and faith, then these conditions do not matter. By always remaining in tune with the Lord through pure love, everything is made auspicious, if one can ever remain united with the Divine through deep devotion, constant remembrance, regular meditation and continuous communion, then all times, places, conditions and situations become auspicious and blessed. This is the secret of invoking His Grace and attaining Him and becoming eternally free and blissful. Arjuna here asks Lord Krishna about the meaning of the different terms referred to by Him in the last two verses of the previous chapter. He wishes to know what is the Supreme Being, what is Karma or action that He refers to, and what is the meaning that pertains to this spirit, the elements and the centre of all things within this human body. Beyond all things manifest and unmanifest, beyond these names and forms, there is the Supreme BeingBrahman. He indwells this body as the centre of all things, including even our own self individual soul. We are a spiritual being residing in this body and supported by the Silent Witness withinthe Supreme Antaryamin. Prakriti or Nature is the being pertaining to the elements. Worship, prayer and offering to the gods with faith and devotion constitute actions that lead to blessedness. The secret of reaching the Divine Being and thus freeing oneself forever from birth and death and the pains and sufferings of this earth-life, is to constantly practise unbroken remembrance of the Lord at all times, in all places and even amidst ones daily activities. If one practises such steady remembrance through regular daily Sadhana, then he will be rooted in His remembrance even at the time of departing from this body at death. Thus departing, he will go beyond darkness and bondage and attain the realm of eternal blessedness. One must practise sense-control. The senses must be well disciplined and gradually withdrawn from outside objects. The mind should be centred within upon God, by uttering Om or any Divine Name. By such steady practice daily the Lord is easily attained. Arjuna Uvaacha: Kim tadbrahma kim adhyaatmam kim karma purushottama; Adhibhootam cha kim proktam adhidaivam kimuchyate. Arjuna said: . What is that Brahman? What is Adhyatma? What is action, O best among men? What is declared to be Adhibhuta? And what is Adhidaiva said to be? Adhiyajnah katham kotra dehesmin madhusoodana; Prayaanakaale cha katham jneyosi niyataatmabhih. . Who and how is Adhiyajna here in this body, O destroyer of Madhu Krishna? And how, at the time of death, art Thou to be known by the self-controlled one? COMMENTARY: In the last two verses of the seventh discourse, Lord Krishna uses certain philosophical terms. Arjuna does not understand their meaning. So he proceeds to question the Lord. Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha: Aksharam brahma paramam swabhaavodhyaatmamuchyate; Bhootabhaavodbhavakaro visargah karmasamjnitah. The Blessed Lord said: . Brahman is the Imperishable, the Supreme; His essential nature is called Self-knowledge; the offering to the gods which causes existence and manifestation of beings and which also sustains them is called action. Adhibhootam ksharo bhaavah purushashchaadhidaivatam; Adhiyajnohamevaatra dehe dehabhritaam vara. . Adhibhuta knowledge of the elements pertains to My perishable Nature, and the Purusha or soul is the Adhidaiva; I alone am the Adhiyajna here in this body, O best among the embodied men! Antakaale cha maameva smaran muktwaa kalevaram; Yah prayaati sa madbhaavam yaati naastyatra samshayah. . And whosoever, leaving the body, goes forth remembering Me alone at the time of death, he attains My Being; there is no doubt about this. Yam yam vaapi smaran bhaavam tyajatyante kalevaram; Tam tamevaiti kaunteya sadaa tadbhaavabhaavitah. . Whosoever at the end leaves the body, thinking of any being, to that being only does he go, O son of Kunti Arjuna, because of his constant thought of that being! COMMENTARY: The most prominent thought of ones life occupies the mind at the time of death. It determines the nature of the body to be attained in the next birth. Tasmaat sarveshu kaaleshu maamanusmara yudhya cha; Mayyarpitamanobuddhir maamevaishyasyasamshayam. . Therefore, at all times remember Me only and fight. With mind and intellect fixed or absorbed in Me, thou shalt doubtless come to Me alone. Abhyaasayogayuktena chetasaa naanyagaaminaa; Paramam purusham divyam yaati paarthaanuchintayan. . With the mind not moving towards any other thing, made steadfast by the method of habitual meditation, and constantly meditating, one goes to the Supreme Person, the Resplendent, O Arjuna! Kavim puraanamanushaasitaaram Anoraneeyaamsam anusmaredyah; Sarvasya dhaataaram achintyaroopam Aadityavarnam tamasah parastaat. . Whosoever meditates on the Omniscient, the Ancient, the ruler of the whole world, minuter than an atom, the supporter of all, of inconceivable form, effulgent like the sun and beyond the darkness of ignorance, Prayaanakaale manasaachalena Bhaktyaa yukto yogabalena chaiva; Bhruvormadhye praanamaaveshya samyak Sa tam param purusham upaiti divyam. . At the time of death, with unshaken mind, endowed with devotion and by the power of Yoga, fixing the whole life-breath in the middle of the two eyebrows, he reaches that resplendent Supreme Person. Yadaksharam vedavido vadanti Vishanti yadyatayo veetaraagaah; Yadicchanto brahmacharyam charanti Tatte padam samgrahena pravakshye. . That which is declared imperishable by those who know the Vedas, that which the self-controlled ascetics and passion-free enter, that desiring which celibacy is practisedthat goal I will declare to thee in brief. Sarvadwaaraani samyamya mano hridi nirudhya cha; Moordhnyaadhaayaatmanah praanamaasthito yogadhaaranaam. . Having closed all the gates, confined the mind in the heart and fixed the life-breath in the head, engaged in the practice of concentration, Omityekaaksharam brahma vyaaharan maamanusmaran; Yah prayaati tyajan deham sa yaati paramaam gatim. . Uttering the monosyllable Omthe Brahmanremembering Me always, he who departs thus, leaving the body, attains to the supreme goal. Ananyachetaah satatam yo maam smarati nityashah; Tasyaaham sulabhah paartha nityayuktasya yoginah. . I am easily attainable by that ever-steadfast Yogi who constantly and daily remembers Me for a long time, not thinking of anything else with a single or one-pointed mind, O Partha Arjuna! COMMENTARY: Constantly remembering the Lord throughout ones life is the easiest way of attaining Him. Maamupetya punarjanma duhkhaalayamashaashwatam; Naapnuvanti mahaatmaanah samsiddhim paramaam gataah. . Having attained Me these great souls do not again take birth here, which is the place of pain and is non-eternal; they have reached the highest perfection liberation. Aabrahmabhuvanaallokaah punaraavartinorjuna; Maamupetya tu kaunteya punarjanma na vidyate. . All the worlds, including the world of Brahma, are subject to return again, O Arjuna! But he who reaches Me, O son of Kunti, has no rebirth! Sahasrayugaparyantam aharyad brahmano viduh; Raatrim yugasahasraantaam tehoraatravido janaah. . Those who know the day of Brahma, which is of a duration of a thousand Yugas ages, and the night, which is also of a thousand Yugas duration, they know day and night. Avyaktaadvyaktayah sarvaah prabhavantyaharaagame; Raatryaagame praleeyante tatraivaavyaktasamjnake. . From the unmanifested all the manifested worlds proceed at the coming of the day; at the coming of the night they dissolve verily into that alone which is called the unmanifested. COMMENTARY: Coming of the day is the commencement of creation. Coming of the night is the commencement of dissolution. Bhootagraamah sa evaayam bhootwaa bhootwaa praleeyate; Raatryaagamevashah paartha prabhavatyaharaagame. . This same multitude of beings, born again and again, is dissolved, helplessly, O Arjuna, into the unmanifested at the coming of the night, and comes forth at the coming of the day! Parastasmaat tu bhaavonyovyaktovyaktaatsanaatanah; Yah sa sarveshu bhooteshu nashyatsu na vinashyati. . But verily there exists, higher than the unmanifested, another unmanifested Eternal who is not destroyed when all beings are destroyed. COMMENTARY: Another unmanifested Eternal refers to Para Brahman, which is distinct from the unmanifested primordial Nature, and which is of quite a different nature. It is superior to Hiranyagarbha the creative Intelligence and the unmanifested Nature because It is their cause. It is not destroyed when all beings from Brahma down to a blade of grass are destroyed. Avyaktokshara ityuktastamaahuh paramaam gatim; Yam praapya na nivartante taddhaama paramam mama. . What is called the Unmanifested and the Imperishable, That they say is the highest goal path. They who reach It do not return to this cycle of births and deaths. That is My highest abode place or state. Purushah sa parah paartha bhaktyaa labhyastwananyayaa; Yasyaantahsthaani bhootaani yena sarvamidam tatam. . That highest Purusha, O Arjuna, is attainable by unswerving devotion to Him alone within whom all beings dwell and by whom all this is pervaded. Yatra kaale twanaavrittim aavrittim chaiva yoginah; Prayaataa yaanti tam kaalam vakshyaami bharatarshabha. . Now I will tell thee, O chief of the Bharatas, the times departing at which the Yogis will return or not return! Agnijyotirahah shuklah shanmaasaa uttaraayanam; Tatra prayaataa gacchanti brahma brahmavido janaah. . Fire, light, daytime, the bright fortnight, the six months of the northern path of the sun northern solsticedeparting then by these, men who know Brahman go to Brahman. Dhoomo raatristathaa krishnah shanmaasaa dakshinaayanam; Tatra chaandramasam jyotir yogee praapya nivartate. . Attaining to the lunar light by smoke, night-time, the dark fortnight or the six months of the southern path of the sun the southern solstice, the Yogi returns. Shuklakrishne gatee hyete jagatah shaashwate mate; Ekayaa yaatyanaavrittim anyayaavartate punah. . The bright and the dark paths of the world are verily thought to be eternal; by the one the bright path a person goes not to return again, and by the other the dark path he returns. COMMENTARY: The bright path is the path to the gods taken by devotees. The dark path is of the manes taken by those who perform sacrifices or charitable acts with the expectation of rewards. Naite sritee paartha jaanan yogee muhyati kashchana; Tasmaat sarveshu kaaleshu yogayukto bhavaarjuna. . Knowing these paths, O Arjuna, no Yogi is deluded! Therefore, at all times be steadfast in Yoga. Vedeshu yajneshu tapahsu chaiva Daaneshu yat punyaphalam pradishtam: Atyeti tatsarvam idam viditwaa Yogee param sthaanamupaiti chaadyam. . Whatever fruits or merits is declared in the scriptures to accrue from the study of the Vedas, the performance of sacrifices, the practice of austerities, and the offering of giftsbeyond all these goes the Yogi, having known this; and he attains to the supreme primeval first or ancient Abode. Hari Om Tat Sat Iti Srimad Bhagavadgeetaasoopanishatsu Brahmavidyaayaam Yogashaastre Sri Krishnaarjunasamvaade Aksharabrahmayogo Naama Ashtamodhyaayah Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita, the science of the Eternal, the scripture of Yoga, the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna, ends the eighth discourse entitled: The Yoga Of the Imperishable Brahman IX The Yoga of the Kingly Science the Kingly Secret Summary of Ninth Discourse Observing that Arjuna was a qualified aspirant and endowed with faith, Krishna declares to him the sovereign knowledge and sovereign secret that is to be known by direct experience. He adds that without faith in this knowledge man fails to reach God and is reborn to suffer. Now the Lord proceeds to describe His nature as the eternal, all-comprehensive Truth. He is everything that is invisible and visible. He pervades everything that exists. He creates everything, sustains everything, and when final dissolution takes place, absorbs everything into Himself. He manifests them again when the next creation begins. All beings who are ignorant of this knowledge are caught helplessly in the cycle of birth and death. In the midst of this creation, preservation and dissolution of the universe, the Lord stands as a silent witness, unaffected and unattached. He is the sole director, sustainer and supervisor of His Cosmic Prakriti. Ignorant beings are not able to recognise the Lord in one who has realised Him. Although these cruel beings assume a human form, their nature is that of demons. The God-realised Mahatma, on the other hand, is a man of knowledge, and perceives Him indwelling all beings and creatures. He beholds the underlying unity of existence in all names and forms. The Lords divine protection is assured to all those who take refuge in Him. Whatever path a devotee follows, he ultimately reaches Him. He is the goal of the various methods of spiritual practice. Devotion, Sri Krishna emphasises, is the essence of all spiritual discipline. If this supreme element is present, then the devotee is freed from bondage. The Lord observes the motive and degree of devotion. Even the most sinful and diabolical man, if he takes a radical turn towards the path of righteousness and truth, reaches the Lord. Whatever vocation one follows, one can attain the Lord if one seeks earnestly and with loving devotion. The essential thing is to fix the mind on the Lord and dedicate everything unto Himones body, mind, actions, emotion and will. Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha: Idam tu te guhyatamam pravakshyaamyanasooyave; Jnaanam vijnaanasahitam yajjnaatwaa mokshyaseshubhaat. The Blessed Lord said: . I shall now declare to thee who does not cavil, the greatest secret, the knowledge combined with experience Self-realisation. Having known this, thou shalt be free from evil. Raajavidyaa raajaguhyam pavitramidamuttamam; Pratyakshaavagamam dharmyam susukham kartumavyayam. . This is the kingly science, the kingly secret, the supreme purifier, realisable by direct intuitional knowledge, according to righteousness, very easy to perform and imperishable. Ashraddhadhaanaah purushaa dharmasyaasya parantapa; Apraapya maam nivartante mrityusamsaaravartmani. . Those who have no faith in this Dharma knowledge of the Self, O Parantapa Arjuna, return to the path of this world of death without attaining Me! Mayaa tatamidam sarvam jagadavyaktamoortinaa; Matsthaani sarvabhootaani na chaaham teshvavasthitah. . All this world is pervaded by Me in My unmanifest aspect; all beings exist in Me, but I do not dwell in them. Na cha matsthaani bhootaani pashya me yogamaishwaram; Bhootabhrinna cha bhootastho mamaatmaa bhootabhaavanah. . Nor do beings exist in Me in reality: behold My divine Yoga, supporting all beings, but not dwelling in them, is My Self, the efficient cause of beings. Yathaakaashasthito nityam vaayuh sarvatrago mahaan; Tathaa sarvaani bhootaani matsthaaneetyupadhaaraya. . As the mighty wind, moving everywhere, rests always in the ether, even so, know thou that all beings rest in Me. Sarvabhootaani kaunteya prakritim yaanti maamikaam; Kalpakshaye punastaani kalpaadau visrijaamyaham. . All beings, O Arjuna, enter into My Nature at the end of a Kalpa; I send them forth again at the beginning of the next Kalpa! Prakritim swaamavashtabhya visrijaami punah punah; Bhootagraamamimam kritsnamavasham prakritervashaat. . Animating My Nature, I again and again send forth all this multitude of beings, helpless by the force of Nature. Na cha maam taani karmaani nibadhnanti dhananjaya; Udaaseenavadaaseenam asaktam teshu karmasu. . These actions do not bind Me, O Arjuna, sitting like one indifferent, unattached to those acts! Mayaadhyakshena prakritih sooyate sacharaacharam; Hetunaanena kaunteya jagadwiparivartate. . Under Me as supervisor, Nature produces the moving and the unmoving; because of this, O Arjuna, the world revolves! Avajaananti maam moodhaah maanusheem tanumaashritam; Param bhaavamajaananto mama bhootamaheshwaram. . Fools disregard Me, clad in human form, not knowing My higher Being as the great Lord of all beings. COMMENTARY: Fools who do not have discrimination despise Me, dwelling in human form. I have taken this body in order to bless My devotees. These fools have no knowledge of My higher Being. I am the great Lord, the Supreme. Moghaashaa moghakarmaano moghajnaanaa vichetasah; Raakshaseemaasureem chaiva prakritim mohineem shritaah. . Of vain hopes, of vain actions, of vain knowledge and senseless, they verily are possessed of the deceitful nature of demons and undivine beings. Mahaatmaanastu maam paartha daiveem prakritimaashritaah; Bhajantyananyamanaso jnaatwaa bhootaadimavyayam. . But the great souls, O Arjuna, partaking of My divine nature, worship Me with a single mind with the mind devoted to nothing else, knowing Me as the imperishable source of beings! Satatam keertayanto maam yatantashcha dridhavrataah; Namasyantashcha maam bhaktyaa nityayuktaa upaasate. . Always glorifying Me, striving, firm in vows, prostrating before Me, they worship Me with devotion, ever steadfast. Jnaanayajnena chaapyanye yajanto maamupaasate; Ekatwena prithaktwena bahudhaa vishwatomukham. . Others also, sacrificing with the wisdom-sacrifice, worship Me, the all-faced, as one, as distinct, and as manifold. Aham kraturaham yajnah swadhaahamahamaushadham; Mantrohamahamevaajyam ahamagniraham hutam. . I am the Kratu; I am the Yajna; I am the offering food to the manes; I am the medicinal herb and all the plants; I am the Mantra; I am also the ghee or melted butter; I am the fire; I am the oblation. Pitaahamasya jagato maataa dhaataa pitaamahah; Vedyam pavitramonkaara riksaama yajureva cha. . I am the father of this world, the mother, the dispenser of the fruits of actions, and the grandfather; the one thing to be known, the purifier, the sacred monosyllable Om, and also the Rig-, the Sama- and Yajur Vedas. Gatirbhartaa prabhuh saakshee nivaasah sharanam suhrit; Prabhavah pralayah sthaanam nidhaanam beejamavyayam. . I am the goal, the support, the Lord, the witness, the abode, the shelter, the friend, the origin, the dissolution, the foundation, the treasure-house and the imperishable seed. Tapaamyahamaham varsham nigrihnaamyutsrijaami cha; Amritam chaiva mrityushcha sadasacchaahamarjuna. . As the sun I give heat; I withhold and send forth the rain; I am immortality and also death, existence and non-existence, O Arjuna! Traividyaa maam somapaah pootapaapaa Yajnairishtwaa swargatim praarthayante; Te punyamaasaadya surendraloka- Mashnanti divyaan divi devabhogaan. . The knowers of the three Vedas, the drinkers of Soma, purified of all sins, worshipping Me by sacrifices, pray for the way to heaven; they reach the holy world of the Lord of the gods and enjoy in heaven the divine pleasures of the gods. Te tam bhuktwaa swargalokam vishaalam Ksheene punye martyalokam vishanti; Evam trayeedharmamanuprapannaa Gataagatam kaamakaamaa labhante. . They, having enjoyed the vast heaven, enter the world of mortals when their merits are exhausted; thus abiding by the injunctions of the three Vedas and desiring objects of desires, they attain to the state of going and returning. COMMENTARY: When their accumulated merits are exhausted, they come to this world again. They have no independence. Ananyaashchintayanto maam ye janaah paryupaasate; Teshaam nityaabhiyuktaanaam yogakshemam vahaamyaham. . To those men who worship Me alone, thinking of no other, of those ever united, I secure what is not already possessed and preserve what they already possess. Yepyanyadevataa bhaktaa yajante shraddhayaanvitaah; Tepi maameva kaunteya yajantyavidhipoorvakam. . Even those devotees who, endowed with faith, worship other gods, worship Me only, O Arjuna, but by the wrong method! Aham hi sarvayajnaanaam bhoktaa cha prabhureva cha; Na tu maamabhijaananti tattwenaatashchyavanti te. . For I alone am the enjoyer and also the Lord of all sacrifices; but they do not know Me in essence in reality, and hence they fall return to this mortal world. Yaanti devavrataa devaan pitreen yaanti pitrivrataah; Bhutaani yaanti bhutejyaa yaanti madyaajinopi maam. . The worshippers of the gods go to them; to the manes go the ancestor-worshippers; to the Deities who preside over the elements go their worshippers; My devotees come to Me. Patram pushpam phalam toyam yo me bhaktyaa prayacchati; Tadaham bhaktyupahritamashnaami prayataatmanah. . Whoever offers Me with devotion and a pure mind heart, a leaf, a flower, a fruit or a little waterI accept this offering. Yatkaroshi yadashnaasi yajjuhoshi dadaasi yat; Yattapasyasi kaunteya tatkurushva madarpanam. . Whatever thou doest, whatever thou eatest, whatever thou offerest in sacrifice, whatever thou givest, whatever thou practiseth as austerity, O Arjuna, do it as an offering unto Me! Shubhaashubhaphalairevam mokshyase karmabandhanaih; Sannyaasayogayuktaatmaa vimukto maamupaishyasi. . Thus shalt thou be freed from the bonds of actions yielding good and evil fruits; with the mind steadfast in the Yoga of renunciation, and liberated, thou shalt come unto Me. Samoham sarvabhooteshu na me dweshyosti na priyah; Ye bhajanti tu maam bhaktyaa mayi te teshu chaapyaham. . The same am I to all beings; to Me there is none hateful or dear; but those who worship Me with devotion are in Me and I am also in them. Api chet suduraachaaro bhajate maamananyabhaak; Saadhureva sa mantavyah samyagvyavasito hi sah. . Even if the most sinful worships Me, with devotion to none else, he too should indeed be regarded as righteous, for he has rightly resolved. Kshipram bhavati dharmaatmaa shashwacchaantim nigacchati; Kaunteya pratijaaneehi na me bhaktah pranashyati. . Soon he becomes righteous and attains to eternal peace; O Arjuna, know thou for certain that My devotee is never destroyed! Maam hi paartha vyapaashritya yepi syuh paapayonayah; Striyo vaishyaastathaa shoodraastepi yaanti paraam gatim. . For, taking refuge in Me, they also, who, O Arjuna, may be of sinful birthwomen, Vaisyas as well as Sudrasattain the Supreme Goal! Kim punarbraahmanaah punyaa bhaktaa raajarshayastathaa; Anityamasukham lokam imam praapya bhajaswa maam. . How much more easily then the holy Brahmins and devoted royal saints attain the goal; having obtained this impermanent and unhappy world, do thou worship Me. Manmanaa bhava madbhakto madyaajee maam namaskuru; Maamevaishyasi yuktwaivamaatmaanam matparaayanah. . Fix thy mind on Me; be devoted to Me; sacrifice unto Me; bow down to Me; having thus united thy whole self with Me, taking Me as the Supreme Goal, thou shalt verily come unto Me. COMMENTARY: The whole being of a man should be surrendered to the Lord without reservation. Then there will be a marvellous transformation. He will have the vision of God everywhere. All sorrows and pains will vanish. His mind will be one with Him. He will for ever have his life and being in the Lord alone. Hari Om Tat Sat Iti Srimad Bhagavadgeetaasoopanishatsu Brahmavidyaayaam Yogashaastre Sri Krishnaarjunasamvaade Raajavidyaa-raajaguhyayogo Naama Navamodhyaayah Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita, the science of the Eternal, the scripture of Yoga, the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna, ends the ninth discourse entitled: The Yoga of the Kingly Science the Kingly Secret X The Yoga of the Divine Glories Summary of Tenth Discourse Krishna tells Arjuna that even the Devas and highly evolved souls fail to understand how He projects Himself as the universe and all its manifestations. He goes on to describe the various qualities that beings manifest according to their Karmas. All these qualitieswisdom, truth, contentment, etc.originate from Him. The true devotees of the Lord are wholly absorbed in Him. They have completely surrendered to Him and through single-minded devotion they are granted the power of discrimination, the discrimination that leads them from the unreal to the Real. Krishna emphatically declares that ignorance is destroyed and knowledge gained through Divine Grace alone. Arjuna accepts the descent of the Supreme in a human form, but wishes to know from the Lord Himself His Cosmic powers by means of which He controls the diverse forces of the universe. The Lord describes His Divine glories, bringing within the range of Arjunas comprehension His limitless manifestations, and how He upholds everything. In short, the Lord is the Almighty Power that creates, sustains and destroys everything. Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha: Bhooya eva mahaabaaho shrinu me paramam vachah; Yatteham preeyamaanaaya vakshyaami hitakaamyayaa. The Blessed Lord said: . Again, O mighty-armed Arjuna, listen to My supreme word which I shall declare to thee who art beloved, for thy welfare! COMMENTARY: The all-compassionate Lord in His mercy wants to encourage Arjuna and cheer him up, and so He Himself comes forward to give him instructions without any request having been made by Arjuna. Na me viduh suraganaah prabhavam na maharshayah; Ahamaadirhi devaanaam maharsheenaam cha sarvashah. . Neither the hosts of the gods nor the great sages know My origin; for, in every way I am the source of all the gods and the great sages. Yo maamajamanaadim cha vetti lokamaheshwaram; Asammoodhah sa martyeshu sarvapaapaih pramuchyate. . He who knows Me as unborn and beginningless, as the great Lord of the worlds, he, among mortals, is undeluded; he is liberated from all sins. COMMENTARY: As the Supreme Being is the cause of all the worlds, He is beginningless. As He is the source of all the gods and the great sages, so there is no source for His own existence. As He is beginningless, He is unborn. He is the great Lord of all the worlds. Buddhir jnaanamasammohah kshamaa satyam damah shamah; Sukham duhkham bhavobhaavo bhayam chaabhayameva cha. . Intellect, wisdom, non-delusion, forgiveness, truth, self-restraint, calmness, happiness, pain, birth or existence, death or non-existence, fear and also fearlessness, Ahimsaa samataa tushtistapo daanam yashoyashah; Bhavanti bhaavaa bhootaanaam matta eva prithagvidhaah. . Non-injury, equanimity, contentment, austerity, fame, beneficence, ill-famethese different kinds of qualities of beings arise from Me alone. Maharshayah sapta poorve chatwaaro manavastathaa; Madbhaavaa maanasaa jaataa yeshaam loka imaah prajaah. . The seven great sages, the ancient four and also the Manus, possessed of powers like Me on account of their minds being fixed on Me, were born of My mind; from them are these creatures born in this world. Etaam vibhootim yogam cha mama yo vetti tattwatah; Sovikampena yogena yujyate naatra samshayah. . He who in truth knows these manifold manifestations of My Being and this Yoga-power of Mine, becomes established in the unshakeable Yoga; there is no doubt about it. Aham sarvasya prabhavo mattah sarvam pravartate; Iti matwaa bhajante maam budhaa bhaavasamanvitaah. . I am the source of all; from Me everything evolves; understanding thus, the wise, endowed with meditation, worship Me. Macchittaa madgatapraanaa bodhayantah parasparam; Kathayantashcha maam nityam tushyanti cha ramanti cha. . With their minds and lives entirely absorbed in Me, enlightening each other and always speaking of Me, they are satisfied and delighted. Teshaam satatayuktaanaam bhajataam preetipoorvakam; Dadaami buddhiyogam tam yena maamupayaanti te. . To them who are ever steadfast, worshipping Me with love, I give the Yoga of discrimination by which they come to Me. COMMENTARY: The devotees who have dedicated themselves to the Lord, who are ever harmonious and self-abiding, who adore Him with intense love, who are ever devout, obtain the Divine Grace. Teshaam evaanukampaartham aham ajnaanajam tamah; Naashayaamyaatmabhaavastho jnaanadeepena bhaaswataa. . Out of mere compassion for them, I, dwelling within their Self, destroy the darkness born of ignorance by the luminous lamp of knowledge. Arjuna Uvaacha: Param brahma param dhaama pavitram paramam bhavaan; Purusham shaashvatam divyam aadidevamajam vibhum. Arjuna said: . Thou art the Supreme Brahman, the supreme abode or the supreme light, the supreme purifier, the eternal, divine Person, the primeval God, unborn and omnipresent. Aahustwaam rishayah sarve devarshirnaaradastathaa; Asito devalo vyaasah swayam chaiva braveeshi me. . All the sages have thus declared Thee, as also the divine sage Narada; so also Asita, Devala and Vyasa; and now Thou Thyself sayest so to me. Sarvametadritam manye yanmaam vadasi keshava; Na hi te bhagavan vyaktim vidurdevaa na daanavaah. . I believe all this that Thou sayest to me as true, O Krishna! Verily, O blessed Lord, neither the gods nor the demons know Thy manifestation origin! Swayamevaatmanaatmaanam vettha twam purushottama; Bhootabhaavana bhootesha devadeva jagatpate. . Verily, Thou Thyself knowest Thyself by Thyself, O Supreme Person, O source and Lord of beings, O God of gods, O ruler of the world! Vaktum arhasyasheshena divyaa hyaatmavibhootayah; Yaabhir vibhootibhir lokaanimaamstwam vyaapya tishthasi. . Thou shouldst indeed tell, without reserve, of Thy divine glories by which Thou existeth, pervading all these worlds. None else can do so. Katham vidyaamaham yogimstwaam sadaa parichintayan; Keshu keshu cha bhaaveshu chintyosi bhagavanmayaa. . How shall I, ever meditating, know Thee, O Yogin? In what aspects or things, O blessed Lord, art Thou to be thought of by me? Vistarenaatmano yogam vibhootim cha janaardana; Bhooyah kathaya triptirhi shrinvato naasti memritam. . Tell me again in detail, O Krishna, of Thy Yogic power and glory; for I am not satisfied with what I have heard of Thy life-giving and nectar-like speech! Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha: Hanta te kathayishyaami divyaa hyaatmavibhootayah; Praadhaanyatah kurushreshtha naastyanto vistarasya me. The Blessed Lord said: . Very well, now I will declare to thee My divine glories in their prominence, O Arjuna! There is no end to their detailed description. COMMENTARY: The Lords divine glories are illimitable.

There is no end to My divine glories, O Arjuna, but this is a brief statement by Me of the particulars of My divine glories!

Whatever being there is that is glorious, prosperous or powerful, that know thou to be a manifestation of a part of My splendour. Athavaa bahunaitena kim jnaatena tavaarjuna; Vishtabhyaahamidam kritsnamekaamshena sthito jagat. . But of what avail to thee is the knowledge of all these details, O Arjuna? I exist, supporting this whole world by one part of Myself. Hari Om Tat Sat Iti Srimad Bhagavadgeetaasoopanishatsu Brahmavidyaayaam Yogashaastre Sri Krishnaarjunasamvaade Vibhootiyogo Naama Dashamodhyaayah Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita, the science of the Eternal, the scripture of Yoga, the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna, ends the tenth discourse entitled: The Yoga of the Divine Glories XI The Yoga of the Vision of the Cosmic Form Summary of Eleventh Discourse Arjunas doubts having been removed through a clear description of the nature of the Atman and the origin and destruction of all created things, he is now ready to behold the Cosmic Vision. Krishna grants him the divine sight by means of which Arjuna beholds the Lord as the vast Cosmic Manifestation. The vision is at once all-comprehensive and simultaneous. In every direction Arjuna sees the Lord as the entire universe. All the created worlds, gods, beings, creatures and things stand revealed as the one gigantic body of the Lord. Arjuna further sees that the great cosmic drama is set in motion and controlled by the all-mighty power of the Lord. His Will alone prevails in all things and actions, both good and bad. The Lord exhorts him to fight, he being only an apparent cause of the destruction of his enemies. Arjuna is unable to bear the pressure of the sudden expansion of consciousness and is filled with fear. He begs the Lord to assume once more His usual form. Krishna reiterates that this vision cannot be had through any amount of austerities, study, sacrifices or philanthrophic acts. Supreme devotion is the only means by which one can have access to His grand vision. Arjuna Uvaacha: Madanugrahaaya paramam guhyamadhyaatmasamjnitam; Yattwayoktam vachastena mohoyam vigato mama. Arjuna said: . By this explanation of the highest secret concerning the Self, which Thou hast spoken out of compassion towards me my delusion is gone. COMMENTARY: After hearing the glories of the Lord, Arjuna has an intense longing to have the wonderful Cosmic Vision. Bhavaapyayau hi bhootaanaam shrutau vistarasho mayaa; Twattah kamalapatraaksha maahaatmyamapi chaavyayam. . The origin and the destruction of beings verily have been heard by me in detail from Thee, O lotus-eyed Lord, and also Thy inexhaustible greatness! Evametadyathaattha twamaatmaanam parameshwara; Drashtumicchaami te roopamaishwaram purushottama. . Now, O Supreme Lord, as Thou hast thus described Thyself, O Supreme Person, I wish to see Thy Divine Form! Manyase yadi tacchakyam mayaa drashtumiti prabho; Yogeshwara tato me twam darshayaatmaanamavyayam. . If Thou, O Lord, thinkest it possible for me to see it, do Thou, then, O Lord of the Yogis, show me Thy imperishable Self! Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha: Pashya me paartha roopaani shatashotha sahasrashah; Naanaavidhaani divyaani naanaavarnaakriteeni cha. The Blessed Lord said: . Behold, O Arjuna, My forms by the hundreds and thousands, of different sorts, divine and of various colours and shapes! Pashyaadityaan vasoon rudraan ashwinau marutastathaa; Bahoonyadrishtapoorvaani pashyaashcharyaani bhaarata. . Behold the Adityas, the Vasus, the Rudras, the two Asvins and also the Maruts; behold many wonders never seen before, O Arjuna! Ihaikastham jagatkritsnam pashyaadya sacharaacharam; Mama dehe gudaakesha yachchaanyad drashtumicchasi. . Now behold, O Arjuna, in this, My body, the whole universe centred in the oneincluding the moving and the unmovingand whatever else thou desirest to see! Na tu maam shakyase drashtum anenaiva swachakshushaa; Divyam dadaami te chakshuh pashya me yogamaishwaram. . But thou art not able to behold Me with these, thine own eyes; I give thee the divine eye; behold My lordly Yoga. COMMENTARY: No fleshy eye can behold Me in My Cosmic Form. One can see Me only through the eye of intuition or the divine eye. It should not be confused with seeing through the physical eye or through the mind. It is an inner divine experience attained through intense devotion and concentration. Sanjaya Uvaacha: Evamuktwaa tato raajan mahaayogeshwaro harih; Darshayaamaasa paarthaaya paramam roopamaishwaram. Sanjaya said: . Having thus spoken, O king, the great Lord of Yoga, Hari Krishna, showed to Arjuna His supreme form as the Lord! Anekavaktra nayanam anekaadbhuta darshanam; Anekadivyaabharanam divyaanekodyataayudham. . With numerous mouths and eyes, with numerous wonderful sights, with numerous divine ornaments, with numerous divine weapons uplifted such a form He showed. Divyamaalyaambaradharam divyagandhaanulepanam; Sarvaashcharyamayam devam anantam vishwatomukham. . Wearing divine garlands and apparel, anointed with divine unguents, the all-wonderful, resplendent Being, endless, with faces on all sides, Divi sooryasahasrasya bhavedyugapadutthitaa; Yadi bhaah sadrishee saa syaadbhaasastasya mahaatmanah. . If the splendour of a thousand suns were to blaze out at once simultaneously in the sky, that would be the splendour of that mighty Being great soul. Tatraikastham jagatkritsnam pravibhaktamanekadhaa; Apashyaddevadevasya shareere paandavastadaa. . There, in the body of the God of gods, Arjuna then saw the whole universe resting in the one, with its many groups. Tatah sa vismayaavishto hrishtaromaa dhananjayah; Pranamya shirasaa devam kritaanjalirabhaashata. . Then, Arjuna, filled with wonder and with hair standing on end, bowed down his head to the Lord and spoke with joined palms. Arjuna Uvaacha: Pashyaami devaamstava deva dehe Sarvaamstathaa bhootavisheshasanghaan; Brahmaanameesham kamalaasanastha- Mrisheemshcha sarvaanuragaamshcha divyaan. Arjuna said: . I behold all the gods, O God, in Thy body, and hosts of various classes of beings; Brahma, the Lord, seated on the lotus, all the sages and the celestial serpents! Anekabaahoodaravaktranetram Pashyaami twaam sarvatonantaroopam; Naantam na madhyam na punastavaadim Pashyaami vishweshwara vishwaroopa. . I see Thee of boundless form on every side, with many arms, stomachs, mouths and eyes; neither the end nor the middle nor also the beginning do I see, O Lord of the universe, O Cosmic Form! Kireetinam gadinam chakrinam cha, Tejoraashim sarvato deeptimantam; Pashyaami twaam durnireekshyam samantaad Deeptaanalaarkadyutimaprameyam. . I see Thee with the diadem, the club and the discus, a mass of radiance shining everywhere, very hard to look at, blazing all round like burning fire and the sun, and immeasurable. Twamaksharam paramam veditavyam Twamasya vishwasya param nidhaanam; Twamavyayah shaashwatadharmagoptaa Sanaatanastwam purusho mato me. . Thou art the Imperishable, the Supreme Being, worthy of being known; Thou art the great treasure-house of this universe; Thou art the imperishable protector of the eternal Dharma; Thou art the ancient Person, I deem. Anaadimadhyaantamanantaveeryam Anantabaahum shashisooryanetram; Pashyaami twaam deeptahutaashavaktram Swatejasaa vishwamidam tapantam. . I see Thee without beginning, middle or end, infinite in power, of endless arms, the sun and the moon being Thy eyes, the burning fire Thy mouth, heating the entire universe with Thy radiance. Dyaavaaprithivyoridamantaram hi Vyaaptam twayaikena dishashcha sarvaah; Drishtwaadbhutam roopamugram tavedam Lokatrayam pravyathitam mahaatman. . The space between the earth and the heaven and all the quarters are filled by Thee alone; having seen this, Thy wonderful and terrible form, the three worlds are trembling with fear, O great-souled Being! Amee hi twaam surasanghaah vishanti Kechid bheetaah praanjalayo grinanti; Swasteetyuktwaa maharshisiddhasanghaah Stuvanti twaam stutibhih pushkalaabhih. . Verily, into Thee enter these hosts of gods; some extol Thee in fear with joined palms: May it be well. Saying thus, bands of great sages and perfected ones praise Thee with complete hymns. Rudraadityaa vasavo ye cha saadhyaa Vishweshvinau marutashchoshmapaashcha; Gandharvayakshaasurasiddhasanghaa Veekshante twaam vismitaashchaiva sarve. . The Rudras, Adityas, Vasus, Sadhyas, Visvedevas, the two Asvins, Maruts, the manes and hosts of celestial singers, Yakshas, demons and the perfected ones, are all looking at Thee in great astonishment. Roopam mahat te bahuvaktranetram Mahaabaaho bahubaahoorupaadam; Bahoodaram bahudamshtraakaraalam Drishtwaa lokaah pravyathitaastathaaham. . Having beheld Thy immeasurable form with many mouths and eyes, O mighty-armed, with many arms, thighs and feet, with many stomachs, and fearful with many teeth, the worlds are terrified and so am I! Nabhahsprisham deeptamanekavarnam Vyaattaananam deeptavishaalanetram; Drishtwaa hi twaam pravyathitaantaraatmaa Dhritim na vindaami shamam cha vishno. . On seeing Thee the Cosmic Form touching the sky, shining in many colours, with mouths wide open, with large, fiery eyes, I am terrified at heart and find neither courage nor peace, O Vishnu! Damshtraakaraalaani cha te mukhaani Drishtwaiva kaalaanalasannibhaani; Disho na jaane na labhe cha sharma Praseeda devesha jagannivaasa. . Having seen Thy mouths, fearful with teeth, blazing like the fires of cosmic dissolution, I know not the four quarters, nor do I find peace. Have mercy, O Lord of the gods! O abode of the universe! Amee cha twaam dhritaraashtrasya putraah Sarve sahaivaavanipaalasanghaih; Bheeshmo dronah sootaputrastathaasau Sahaasmadeeyairapi yodhamukhyaih. . All the sons of Dhritarashtra with the hosts of kings of the earth, Bhishma, Drona and Karna, with the chief among all our warriors, Vaktraani te twaramaanaa vishanti Damshtraakaraalaani bhayaanakaani; Kechidwilagnaa dashanaantareshu Sandrishyante choornitairuttamaangaih. . They hurriedly enter into Thy mouths with terrible teeth and fearful to behold. Some are found sticking in the gaps between the teeth, with their heads crushed to powder. Yathaa nadeenaam bahavombuvegaah Samudramevaabhimukhaah dravanti; Tathaa tavaamee naralokaveeraah Vishanti vaktraanyabhivijwalanti. . Verily, just as many torrents of rivers flow towards the ocean, even so these heroes of the world of men enter Thy flaming mouths. COMMENTARY: Arjuna sees all the warriors, whom he did not wish to kill, rushing to death. He knows now that the Lord has already destroyed them, so why should he worry about the inevitable. Yathaa pradeeptam jwalanam patangaa Vishanti naashaaya samriddhavegaah; Tathaiva naashaaya vishanti lokaas Tavaapi vaktraani samriddhavegaah. . As moths hurriedly rush into a blazing fire for their own destruction, so also these creatures hurriedly rush into Thy mouths for their own destruction. Lelihyase grasamaanah samantaal Lokaan samagraan vadanair jwaladbhih; Tejobhiraapoorya jagatsamagram Bhaasastavograah pratapanti vishno. . Thou lickest up, devouring all the worlds on every side with Thy flaming mouths. Thy fierce rays, filling the whole world with radiance, are burning, O Vishnu! Aakhyaahi me ko bhavaanugraroopo Namostu te devavara praseeda; Vijnaatumicchaami bhavantamaadyam Na hi prajaanaami tava pravrittim. . Tell me, who Thou art, so fierce in form. Salutations to Thee, O God Supreme! Have mercy; I desire to know Thee, the original Being. I know not indeed Thy doing. Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha: Kaalosmi lokakshayakrit pravriddho Lokaan samaahartumiha pravrittah; Ritepi twaam na bhavishyanti sarve Yewasthitaah pratyaneekeshu yodhaah. The Blessed Lord said: . I am the mighty world-destroying Time, now engaged in destroying the worlds. Even without thee, none of the warriors arrayed in the hostile armies shall live. Tasmaat twam uttishtha yasho labhaswa Jitwaa shatroon bhungkshwa raajyam samriddham; Mayaivaite nihataah poorvameva Nimittamaatram bhava savyasaachin. . Therefore, stand up and obtain fame. Conquer the enemies and enjoy the unrivalled kingdom. Verily, they have already been slain by Me; be thou a mere instrument, O Arjuna!

Drona, Bhishma, Jayadratha, Karna and all the other courageous warriorsthese have already been slain by Me; do thou kill; be not distressed with fear; fight and thou shalt conquer thy enemies in battle. Sanjaya Uvaacha: Etacchrutwaa vachanam keshavasya Kritaanjalirvepamaanah kireetee; Namaskritwaa bhooya evaaha krishnam Sagadgadam bheetabheetah pranamya. Sanjaya said: . Having heard that speech of Lord Krishna, the crowned one Arjuna, with joined palms, trembling, prostrating himself, again addressed Krishna, in a choked voice, bowing down, overwhelmed with fear. Arjuna Uvaacha: Sthaane hrisheekesha tava prakeertyaa Jagat prahrishyatyanurajyate cha; Rakshaamsi bheetaani disho dravanti Sarve namasyanti cha siddhasanghaah. Arjuna said: . It is meet, O Krishna, that the world delights and rejoices in Thy praise; demons fly in fear to all quarters and the hosts of the perfected ones bow to Thee! Kasmaachcha te na nameran mahaatman Gareeyase brahmanopyaadikartre; Ananta devesha jagannivaasa Twamaksharam sadasattatparam yat. . And why should they not, O great soul, bow to Thee who art greater than all else, the primal cause even of Brahma the creator, O Infinite Being! O Lord of the gods! O abode of the universe! Thou art the imperishable, the Being, the non-being and That which is the supreme that which is beyond the Being and non-being. COMMENTARY: The Lord is Mahatma. He is greater than all else. He is the imperishable, so He is the proper object of worship, love and delight. Twamaadidevah purushah puraanas Twamasya vishwasya param nidhaanam; Vettaasi vedyam cha param cha dhaama Twayaa tatam vishwamanantaroopa. . Thou art the primal God, the ancient Purusha, the supreme refuge of this universe, the knower, the knowable and the supreme abode. By Thee is the universe pervaded, O Being of infinite forms! Vaayuryamognirvarunah shashaankah Prajaapatistwam prapitaamahashcha; Namo namastestu sahasrakritwah Punashcha bhooyopi namo namaste. . Thou art Vayu, Yama, Agni, Varuna, the moon, the creator, and the great-grandfather. Salutations, salutations unto Thee, a thousand times, and again salutations, salutations unto Thee! Namah purastaadatha prishthataste Namostu te sarvata eva sarva; Anantaveeryaamitavikramastwam Sarvam samaapnoshi tatosi sarvah. . Salutations to Thee from front and from behind! Salutations to Thee on every side! O All! Thou infinite in power and prowess, pervadest all; wherefore Thou art all. Sakheti matwaa prasabham yaduktam He krishna he yaadava he sakheti; Ajaanataa mahimaanam tavedam Mayaa pramaadaat pranayena vaapi. . Whatever I have presumptuously uttered from love or carelessness, addressing Thee as O Krishna! O Yadava! O Friend! regarding Thee merely as a friend, unknowing of this, Thy greatness, Yachchaavahaasaartham asatkritosi Vihaarashayyaasanabhojaneshu; Ekothavaapyachyuta tatsamaksham Tatkshaamaye twaamaham aprameyam. . In whatever way I may have insulted Thee for the sake of fun while at play, reposing, sitting or at meals, when alone with Thee, O Achyuta, or in companythat I implore Thee, immeasurable one, to forgive! Pitaasi lokasya charaacharasya Twamasya poojyashcha gururgareeyaan; Na twatsamostyabhyadhikah kutonyo Lokatrayepyapratimaprabhaava. . Thou art the Father of this world, unmoving and moving. Thou art to be adored by this world. Thou art the greatest Guru; for none there exists who is equal to Thee; how then can there be another superior to Thee in the three worlds, O Being of unequalled power? Tasmaatpranamya pranidhaaya kaayam Prasaadaye twaamahameeshameedyam; Piteva putrasya sakheva sakhyuh Priyah priyaayaarhasi deva sodhum. . Therefore, bowing down, prostrating my body, I crave Thy forgiveness, O adorable Lord! As a father forgives his son, a friend his dear friend, a lover his beloved, even so shouldst Thou forgive me, O God! Adrishtapoorvam hrishitosmi drishtwaa Bhayena cha pravyathitam mano me; Tadeva me darshaya deva roopam Praseeda devesha jagannivaasa. . I am delighted, having seen what has never been seen before; and yet my mind is distressed with fear. Show me that previous form only, O God! Have mercy, O God of gods! O abode of the universe! Kireetinam gadinam chakrahastam Icchaami twaam drashtumaham tathaiva; Tenaiva roopena chaturbhujena Sahasrabaaho bhava vishwamoorte. . I desire to see Thee as before, crowned, bearing a mace, with the discus in hand, in Thy former form only, having four arms, O thousand-armed, Cosmic Form Being! Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha: Mayaa prasannena tavaarjunedam Roopam param darshitamaatmayogaat; Tejomayam vishwamanantamaadyam Yanme twadanyena na drishtapoorvam. The Blessed Lord said: . O Arjuna, this Cosmic Form has graciously been shown to thee by Me by My own Yogic power; full of splendour, primeval, and infinite, this Cosmic Form of Mine has never been seen before by anyone other than thyself. Na vedayajnaadhyayanairna daanair Na cha kriyaabhirna tapobhirugraih; Evam roopah shakya aham nriloke Drashtum twadanyena karupraveera. . Neither by the study of the Vedas and sacrifices, nor by gifts, nor by rituals, nor by severe austerities, can I be seen in this form in the world of men by any other than thyself, O great hero of the Kurus Arjuna! Maa te vyathaa maa cha vimoodhabhaavo Drishtwaa roopam ghorameedringmamedam; Vyapetabheeh preetamanaah punastwam Tadeva me roopamidam prapashya. . Be not afraid nor bewildered on seeing such a terrible form of Mine as this; with thy fear entirely dispelled and with a gladdened heart, now behold again this former form of Mine. Sanjaya Uvaacha: Ityarjunam vaasudevastathoktwaa Swakam roopam darshayaamaasa bhooyah; Aashwaasayaamaasa cha bheetamenam Bhootwaa punah saumyavapurmahaatmaa. Sanjaya said: . Having thus spoken to Arjuna, Krishna again showed His own form; and the great soul Krishna, assuming His gentle form, consoled him who was terrified Arjuna. Arjuna Uvaacha: Drishtwedam maanusham roopam tava saumyam janaardana; Idaaneemasmi samvrittah sachetaah prakritim gatah. Arjuna said: . Having seen this Thy gentle human form, O Krishna, now I am composed and restored to my own nature! Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha: Sudurdarshamidam roopam drishtavaanasi yanmama; Devaa apyasya roopasya nityam darshanakaangkshinah. The Blessed Lord said: . Very hard indeed it is to see this form of Mine which thou hast seen. Even the gods are ever longing to behold it. Naa ham vedairna tapasaa na daanena na chejyayaa; Shakya evamvidho drashtum drishtavaanasi maam yathaa. . Neither by the Vedas, nor by austerity, nor by gift, nor by sacrifice, can I be seen in this form as thou hast seen Me so easily. Bhaktyaa twananyayaa shakyam aham evamvidhorjuna; Jnaatum drashtum cha tattwena praveshtum cha parantapa. . But by single-minded devotion can I, of this form, be known and seen in reality and also entered into, O Arjuna! Matkarmakrinmatparamo madbhaktah sangavarjitah; Nirvairah sarvabhooteshu yah sa maameti paandava. . He who does all actions for Me, who looks upon Me as the Supreme, who is devoted to Me, who is free from attachment, who bears enmity towards no creature, he comes to Me, O Arjuna! COMMENTARY: This is the essence of the whole teaching of the Gita. He who practises this teaching attains supreme bliss and immortality. Such a one realises Him and enters into His Being, becoming completely one with Him. This verse contains the summary of the entire Gita philosophy. Hari Om Tat Sat Iti Srimad Bhagavadgeetaasoopanishatsu Brahmavidyaayaam Yogashaastre Sri Krishnaarjunasamvaade Vishwaroopa Darshanayogo Naama Ekaadashodhyaayah Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita, the science of the Eternal, the scripture of Yoga, the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna, ends the eleventh discourse entitled: The Yoga of the Vision of the Cosmic Form XII The Yoga of Devotion Summary of Twelfth Discourse The twelfth discourse indicates that the path of devotion is easier than the path of knowledge. In this path the aspirant worships God in His Cosmic Form of the Supreme Personality. He develops a loving relationship with Him, adores Him, remembers Him and chants His glories and Name. He thus effects union with the Lord and attains not only His formless aspect but also the Lord as the manifest universe. The path of knowledge, whereby the aspirant meditates on the formless Brahman, is more difficult as he has to give up his attachment to the body from the very beginning. He has to have dispassion for the things of the world. How to practise devotion? Krishna asks Arjuna to fix his entire mind on Him. As often as the mind wanders it should be brought back to the Lord. If this process of concentration is difficult he should dedicate all his actions to Him, feeling that it is His power that activates everything. If this also is beyond his ability, he should offer all his actions to the Lord, abandoning the desire for their fruits. He should take complete refuge in Him. The devotee who surrenders himself to the Lord attains perfect peace. The Lord goes on to describe the qualities that a true devotee possesses. He neither attaches himself to anything nor does he have any aversion to things. He has a balanced mind under all circumstances. He is not agitated by the happenings of the world, nor does he himself cause any agitation in others. He is perfectly desireless and rejoices in the Lord within. He sees equality everywhere, being untouched by sorrow, fear, honour as also dishonour. He is perfectly content as he has surrendered his entire being to the Lord. Arjuna Uvaacha: Evam satatayuktaa ye bhaktaastwaam paryupaasate; Ye chaapyaksharamavyaktam teshaam ke yogavittamaah. Arjuna said: . Those devotees who, ever steadfast, thus worship Thee and those also who worship the Imperishable and the Unmanifestedwhich of them are better versed in Yoga? COMMENTARY: The twelfth discourse indicates that Bhakti Yoga is much easier than Jnana Yoga or the Yoga of knowledge. Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha: Mayyaaveshya mano ye maam nityayuktaa upaasate; Shraddhayaa parayopetaaste me yuktatamaa mataah. The Blessed Lord said: . Those who, fixing their minds on Me, worship Me, ever steadfast and endowed with supreme faith, these are the best in Yoga in My opinion. Ye twaksharamanirdeshyamavyaktam paryupaasate; Sarvatragamachintyam cha kootasthamachalam dhruvam. . Those who worship the imperishable, the indefinable, the unmanifested, the omnipresent, the unthinkable, the eternal and the immovable, Samniyamyendriyagraamam sarvatra samabuddhayah; Te praapnuvanti maameva sarvabhootahite rataah. . Having restrained all the senses, even-minded everywhere, intent on the welfare of all beingsverily they also come unto Me. Kleshodhikatarasteshaam avyaktaasaktachetasaam; Avyaktaa hi gatirduhkham dehavadbhiravaapyate. . Greater is their trouble whose minds are set on the Unmanifested; for the goalthe Unmanifestedis very difficult for the embodied to reach. COMMENTARY: The embodiedthose who identify themselves with their bodies. The imperishable Self is very hard to reach for those who are attached to their bodies. Their restless minds will not be able to get fixed on the attributeless Self. Ye tu sarvaani karmaani mayi sannyasya matparaah; Ananyenaiva yogena maam dhyaayanta upaasate. . But to those who worship Me, renouncing all actions in Me, regarding Me as the supreme goal, meditating on Me with single-minded Yoga, Teshaamaham samuddhartaa mrityusamsaarasaagaraat; Bhavaami nachiraat paartha mayyaaveshitachetasaam. . To those whose minds are set on Me, O Arjuna, verily I become ere long the saviour out of the ocean of the mortal Samsara! Mayyeva mana aadhatswa mayi buddhim niveshaya; Nivasishyasi mayyeva ata oordhwam na samshayah. . Fix thy mind on Me only, thy intellect in Me, then thou shait no doubt live in Me alone hereafter. Atha chittam samaadhaatum na shaknoshi mayi sthiram; Abhyaasayogena tato maamicchaaptum dhananjaya. . If thou art unable to fix thy mind steadily on Me, then by the Yoga of constant practice do thou seek to reach Me, O Arjuna! Abhyaasepyasamarthosi matkarmaparamo bhava; Madarthamapi karmaani kurvansiddhimavaapsyasi. . If thou art unable to practise even this Abhyasa Yoga, be thou intent on doing actions for My sake; even by doing actions for My sake, thou shalt attain perfection. Athaitadapyashaktosi kartum madyogamaashritah; Sarvakarmaphalatyaagam tatah kuru yataatmavaan. . If thou art unable to do even this, then, taking refuge in union with Me, renounce the fruits of all actions with the self controlled. Shreyo hi jnaanamabhyaasaat jnaanaaddhyaanam vishishyate; Dhyaanaat karmaphalatyaagas tyaagaacchaantir anantaram. . Better indeed is knowledge than practice; than knowledge meditation is better; than meditation the renunciation of the fruits of actions; peace immediately follows renunciation. Adweshtaa sarvabhootaanaam maitrah karuna eva cha; Nirmamo nirahankaarah samaduhkhasukhah kshamee. . He who hates no creature, who is friendly and compassionate to all, who is free from attachment and egoism, balanced in pleasure and pain, and forgiving, Santushtah satatam yogee yataatmaa dridhanishchayah; Mayyarpitamanobuddhiryo madbhaktah sa me priyah. . Ever content, steady in meditation, possessed of firm conviction, self-controlled, with mind and intellect dedicated to Me, he, My devotee, is dear to Me. Yasmaannodwijate loko lokaannodwijate cha yah; Harshaamarshabhayodwegairmukto yah sa cha me priyah. . He by whom the world is not agitated and who cannot be agitated by the world, and who is freed from joy, envy, fear and anxietyhe is dear to Me. Anapekshah shuchirdaksha udaaseeno gatavyathah; Sarvaarambhaparityaagee yo madbhaktah sa me priyah. . He who is free from wants, pure, expert, unconcerned, and untroubled, renouncing all undertakings or commencementshe who is thus devoted to Me, is dear to Me. Yona hrishyati na dweshti na shochati na kaangkshati; Shubhaashubhaparityaagee bhaktimaan yah sa me priyah. . He who neither rejoices, nor hates, nor grieves, nor desires, renouncing good and evil, and who is full of devotion, is dear to Me. COMMENTARY: He does not rejoice when he attains desirable objects nor does he grieve when he parts with his cherished objects. Further, he does not desire the unattained. Samah shatrau cha mitre cha tathaa maanaapamaanayoh; Sheetoshnasukhaduhkheshu samah sangavivarjitah. . He who is the same to foe and friend, and in honour and dishonour, who is the same in cold and heat and in pleasure and pain, who is free from attachment, Tulyanindaastutirmaunee santushto yena kenachit: Aniketah sthiramatir bhaktimaan me priyo narah. . He to whom censure and praise are equal, who is silent, content with anything, homeless, of a steady mind, and full of devotionthat man is dear to Me. Ye tu dharmyaamritamidam yathoktam paryupaasate; Shraddhadhaanaah matparamaa bhaktaasteteeva me priyaah. . They verily who follow this immortal Dharma doctrine or law as described above, endowed with faith, regarding Me as their supreme goal, they, the devotees, are exceedingly dear to Me. Hari Om Tat Sat Iti Srimad Bhagavadgeetaasoopanishatsu Brahmavidyaayaam Yogashaastre Sri Krishnaarjunasamvaade Bhaktiyogo Naama Dwaadashodhyaayah Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita, the science of the Eternal, the scripture of Yoga, the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna, ends the twelfth discourse entitled: The Yoga of Devotion XIII The Yoga of Distinction Between The Field the Knower of the Field Summary of Thirteenth Discourse In this discourse we have one of the most significant, most illuminating, most inspiring and most mystical portions of the Bhagavad Gita. The Lord gives us a wonderfully revealing insight into the human individual. It is the metaphysics of man, the unknown. The immortal Soul, with its physical embodiment, is the main theme of this discourse. The supreme transcendental Spirit, which is the eternal substratum beyond both, is also described in a wonderful manner. The knower of the Supreme Reality is instantly liberated. The blessed Lord tells us that the knowledge of the Field and the Knower of the Field is the true knowledge. This highest and the best knowledge grants us divine wisdom and spiritual illumination that lead to divine beatitude. This body is the Field. The Immortal Soul yourself, dwelling in the body is the Knower of the Field. Verily, it is the Supreme Being who has projected Himself and assumed the form of this Knower of the Field within this body. This self is none other than That. Thus, Lord Krishna explains the mystery of the individual soul dwelling within this mortal body. This knowledge constitutes the main subject matter of all the scriptures and the highest philosophical works. The five elements, the ego, the mind, intellect and the ten organs, desire and aversion and such factors constitute the Field. Next follows a wonderful summing-up of what constitutes true knowledge. Then follows the declaration of the Supreme Soul, the knowledge of which grants us immortality. That Supreme Reality is the one universal Essence present everywhere. It pervades all. It shines within the inmost chambers of our heart, it is everything, it is the one seer, the witness, the guide, sustainer, experiencer and Lord of all. One who knows this mystery is not bound by activity even in the midst of life. When we perceive this supreme Presence dwelling in all beings we cannot injure anyone. Krishna asks us to see and know the difference between the Field body or Prakriti and the Knower of the Field Spirit or Purusha, and thus reach the Self. This is the teaching and the message of this illuminating discourse. Arjuna Uvaacha: Prakritim purusham chaiva kshetram kshetrajnameva cha; Etadveditumicchaami jnaanam jneyam cha keshava. Arjuna said: . I wish to learn about Nature matter and the Spirit soul, the Field and the Knower of the Field, knowledge and that which ought to be known. Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha: Idam shareeram kaunteya kshetramityabhidheeyate; Etadyo vetti tam praahuh kshetrajna iti tadvidah. The Blessed Lord said: . This body, O Arjuna, is called the Field; he who knows it is called the Knower of the Field by those who know of them, that is, by the sages. Kshetrajnam chaapi maam viddhi sarvakshetreshu bhaarata; Kshetrakshetrajnayor jnaanam yattat jnaanam matam mama. . Do thou also know Me as the Knower of the Field in all fields, O Arjuna! Knowledge of both the Field and the Knower of the Field is considered by Me to be the knowledge. Tat kshetram yaccha yaadrik cha yadvikaari yatashcha yat; Sa cha yo yatprabhaavashcha tatsamaasena me shrinu. . What the Field is and of what nature, what its modifications are and whence it is, and also who He is and what His powers arehear all that from Me in brief. Rishibhirbahudhaa geetam cchandobhirvividhaih prithak; Brahmasootrapadaishchaiva hetumadbhirvinishchitaih. . Sages have sung in many ways, in various distinctive chants and also in the suggestive words indicative of the Absolute, full of reasoning and decisive. Mahaabhootaanyahankaaro buddhiravyaktameva cha; Indriyaani dashaikam cha pancha chendriyagocharaah. . The great elements, egoism, intellect and also unmanifested Nature, the ten senses and one, and the five objects of the senses, COMMENTARY: Great elements: earth, water, fire, air and ether are so called because they pervade all modifications of matter. The ten senses are: the five organs of knowledge ears, skin, eyes, tongue and nose, and the five organs of action hand, feet, mouth, anus and generative organ. The one: this is the mind. The five objects of the senses are sound, touch, form colour, taste and smell. Icchaa dweshah sukham duhkham sanghaatashchetanaa dhritih; Etat kshetram samaasena savikaaramudaahritam. . Desire, hatred, pleasure, pain, the aggregate the body, fortitude and intelligencethe Field has thus been described briefly with its modifications. Amaanitwam adambhitwam ahimsaa kshaantiraarjavam; Aachaaryopaasanam shaucham sthairyamaatmavinigrahah. . Humility, unpretentiousness, non-injury, forgiveness, uprightness, service of the teacher, purity, steadfastness, self-control, Indriyaartheshu vairaagyamanahankaara eva cha; Janmamrityujaraavyaadhi duhkhadoshaanu darshanam. . Indifference to the objects of the senses, also absence of egoism, perception of or reflection on the evil in birth, death, old age, sickness and pain, Asaktiranabhishwangah putradaaragrihaadishu; Nityam cha samachittatwam ishtaanishtopapattishu. . Non-attachment, non-identification of the Self with son, wife, home and the rest, and constant even-mindedness on the attainment of the desirable and the undesirable, Mayi chaananyayogena bhaktiravyabhichaarinee; Viviktadesha sevitwam aratir janasamsadi. . Unswerving devotion unto Me by the Yoga of non-separation, resort to solitary places, distaste for the society of men, Adhyaatma jnaana nityatwam tattwa jnaanaartha darshanam; Etajjnaanamiti proktam ajnaanam yadatonyathaa. . Constancy in Self-knowledge, perception of the end of true knowledgethis is declared to be knowledge, and what is opposed to it is ignorance. Jneyam yattat pravakshyaami yajjnaatwaamritamashnute; Anaadimatparam brahma na sattannaasaduchyate. . I will declare that which has to be known, knowing which one attains to immortality, the beginningless supreme Brahman, called neither being nor non-being. Sarvatah paanipaadam tat sarvatokshishiromukham; Sarvatah shrutimalloke sarvamaavritya tishthati. . With hands and feet everywhere, with eyes, heads and mouths everywhere, with ears everywhere, He exists in the worlds, enveloping all. Sarvendriyagunaabhaasam sarvendriyavivarjitam; Asaktam sarvabhricchaiva nirgunam gunabhoktru cha. . Shining by the functions of all the senses, yet without the senses; unattached, yet supporting all; devoid of qualities, yet their experiencer, Bahirantashcha bhootaanaam acharam charameva cha; Sookshmatwaat tadavijneyam doorastham chaantike cha tat. . Without and within all beings, the unmoving and also the moving; because of His subtlety, unknowable; and near and far away is That. Avibhaktam cha bhooteshu vibhaktamiva cha sthitam; Bhootabhartru cha tajjneyam grasishnu prabhavishnu cha. . And undivided, yet He exists as if divided in beings; He is to be known as the supporter of beings; He devours and He generates also. Jyotishaamapi tajjyotistamasah paramuchyate; Jnaanam jneyam jnaanagamyam hridi sarvasya vishthitam. . That, the Light of all lights, is beyond darkness; it is said to be knowledge, the Knowable and the goal of knowledge, seated in the hearts of all. Iti kshetram tathaa jnaanam jneyam choktam samaasatah; Madbhakta etadvijnaaya madbhaavaayopapadyate. . Thus the Field as well as knowledge and the Knowable have been briefly stated. My devotee, knowing this, enters into My Being. Prakritim purusham chaiva viddhyaanaadee ubhaavapi; Vikaaraamshcha gunaamshchaiva viddhi prakritisambhavaan. . Know thou that Nature and Spirit are beginningless; and know also that all modifications and qualities are born of Nature. Kaaryakaaranakartrutwe hetuh prakritiruchyate; Purushah sukhaduhkhaanaam bhoktritwe heturuchyate. . In the production of the effect and the cause, Nature matter is said to be the cause; in the experience of pleasure and pain, the soul is said to be the cause. Purushah prakritistho hi bhungkte prakritijaan gunaan; Kaaranam gunasangosya sadasadyoni janmasu. . The soul seated in Nature experiences the qualities born of Nature; attachment to the qualities is the cause of his birth in good and evil wombs. Upadrashtaanumantaa cha bhartaa bhoktaa maheshwarah; Paramaatmeti chaapyukto dehesmin purushah parah. . The Supreme Soul in this body is also called the spectator, the permitter, the supporter, the enjoyer, the great Lord and the Supreme Self. Ya evam vetti purusham prakritim cha gunaih saha; Sarvathaa vartamaanopi na sa bhooyobhijaayate. . He who thus knows Spirit and Matter, together with the qualities, in whatever condition he may be, he is not reborn. Dhyaanenaatmani pashyanti kechidaatmaanamaatmanaa; Anye saankhyena yogena karmayogena chaapare. . Some by meditation behold the Self in the Self by the Self, others by the Yoga of knowledge, and others by the Yoga of action. Anye twevamajaanantah shrutwaanyebhya upaasate; Tepi chaatitarantyeva mrityum shrutiparaayanaah. . Others also, not knowing thus, worship, having heard of it from others; they, too, cross beyond death, regarding what they have heard as the supreme refuge. Yaavat sanjaayate kinchit sattwam sthaavarajangamam; Kshetrakshetrajnasamyogaat tadviddhi bharatarshabha. . Wherever a being is born, whether it be unmoving or moving, know thou, O best of the Bharatas Arjuna, that it is from the union between the Field and its Knower. Samam sarveshu bhooteshu tishthantam parameshwaram; Vinashyatswavinashyantam yah pashyati sa pashyati. . He sees, who sees the Supreme Lord, existing equally in all beings, the unperishing within the perishing. COMMENTARY: Birth is the root cause of the modifications of change, growth, decay and death. The other changes of state manifest after the birth of the body. But the Lord is changeless and He is birthless, decayless and deathless. Samam pashyan hi sarvatra samavasthitameeshwaram; Na hinastyaatmanaatmaanam tato yaati paraam gatim. . Because he who sees the same Lord dwelling equally everywhere does not destroy the Self by the self, he goes to the highest goal. Prakrityaiva cha karmaani kriyamaanaani sarvashah; Yah pashyati tathaatmaanam akartaaram sa pashyati. . He sees, who sees that all actions are performed by Nature alone and that the Self is actionless. Yadaa bhootaprithagbhaavam ekastham anupashyati; Tata eva cha vistaaram brahma sampadyate tadaa. . When a man sees the whole variety of beings as resting in the One, and spreading forth from That alone, he then becomes Brahman. COMMENTARY: A man attains to unity with the Supreme when he knows or realises through intuition that all these manifold forms are rooted in the One. Like waves in water, like rays in the sun, so also all forms are rooted in the One. Anaaditwaan nirgunatwaat paramaatmaayam avyayah; Shareerasthopi kaunteya na karoti na lipyate. . Being without beginning and devoid of any qualities, the Supreme Self, imperishable, though dwelling in the body, O Arjuna, neither acts nor is tainted! Yathaa sarvagatam saukshmyaadaakaasham nopalipyate; Sarvatraavasthito dehe tathaatmaa nopalipyate. . As the all-pervading ether is not tainted because of its subtlety, so the Self seated everywhere in the body, is not tainted. Yathaa prakaashayatyekah kritsnam lokamimam ravih; Kshetram kshetree tathaa kritsnam prakaashayati bhaarata. . Just as the one sun illumines the whole world, so also the Lord of the Field the Supreme Self illumines the whole Field, O Arjuna! Kshetrakshetrajnayor evam antaram jnaanachakshushaa; Bhootaprakritimoksham cha ye vidur yaanti te param. . They who, through the eye of knowledge, perceive the distinction between the Field and its Knower, and also the liberation from the Nature of being, they go to the Supreme. COMMENTARY: They who know through the eye of intuition opened by meditation and the instructions of the Guru and the scriptures, that the Field is insentient, the doer, changing and finite, and that the Knower of the Field is pure Consciousness, the non-doer, unchanging and infinite, and who also perceive the non-existence of Nature, ignorance, the Unmanifested, the material cause of being,they attain the Supreme. Hari Om Tat Sat Iti Srimad Bhagavadgeetaasoopanishatsu Brahmavidyaayaam Yogashaastre Sri Krishnaarjunasamvaade Kshetrakshetrajnavibhaagayogo Naama Trayodashodhyaayah Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita, the science of the Eternal, the scripture of Yoga, the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna, ends the thirteenth discourse entitled: The Yoga of the Distinction Between The Field and the Knower of the Field XIV The Yoga of the Division of the Three Gunas Summary of Fourteenth Discourse Knowledge of the three cosmic qualities or Gunas, namely, Sattwa, Rajas and Tamas is now given through this discourse. The knowledge of these three Gunas, which hold the entire universe and all creatures under their sway, is of vital importance to each and everyone for their progress and happiness in life. Without this knowledge one will be forever bound by sorrow. In this knowledge we have the secret of success in worldly life as well as in spiritual life. Therefore, one should acquire this precious knowledge. Lord Krishna reveals that these three qualities compose the Cosmic Nature. This Cosmic Nature is the primal source and origin of the entire creation and all things in it. Hence all things created are subject to their influence and irresistible power. The individual soul also is bound to the body by these three qualities present in Cosmic Nature. The Supreme Being brings about creation through the help of His Prakriti Nature endowed with these threefold qualities. The highest of the three qualities is Sattwa. It is pure. It brings about happiness, wisdom and also illumination. The second quality of Rajas gives rise to passion manifested by intense attachment and greed. It causes sorrow and suffering. The third, termed Tamas, is the worst of all. It arises due to ignorance and results in darkness, lethargy and delusion. Krishna asks us to diligently endeavour to cast out Tamas from our nature. We should control and master Rajas, and by holding it in check, wisely divert its power towards good kinds of activities. Sattwa should be carefully cultivated, developed and conserved in order to enable us to attain immortality. The realised sage, of course, goes beyond all these qualities, for, although it is Sattwa that enables him to reach God, even this quality will bind him if he is attached to it. The aspirant should know the symptoms and signs of their presence in his personality and acquire a knowledge of their subtle workings. Then only can he maintain an unhampered and smooth progress in all activities of his life, both secular as well as spiritual. Lord Krishna teaches us this important subject in this discourse from the ninth to the eighteenth verse. He declares that one who rises beyond all the three Gunas through spiritual practices, becomes free from birth, death, old age and sorrow, and enjoys immortality. In reply to a question from Arjuna, the blessed Lord describes the marks of one who has risen above the three Gunas. He states that if one constantly worships Him with exclusive devotion one will attain the highest divine experience and supreme peace and blessedness. Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha: Param bhooyah pravakshyaami jnaanaanaam jnaanamuttamam; Yajjnaatwaa munayah sarve paraam siddhimito gataah. The Blessed Lord said: . I will again declare to thee that supreme knowledge, the best of all knowledge, having known which all the sages have gone to the supreme perfection after this life. Idam jnaanam upaashritya mama saadharmyam aagataah; Sargepi nopajaayante pralaye na vyathanti cha. . They who, having taken refuge in this knowledge, attain to unity with Me, are neither born at the time of creation nor are they disturbed at the time of dissolution. COMMENTARY: In this verse it is knowledge of the Supreme Self that is eulogised by the Lord. Mama yonirmahadbrahma tasmin garbham dadhaamyaham; Sambhavah sarvabhootaanaam tato bhavati bhaarata. . My womb is the great Brahma; in that I place the germ; thence, O Arjuna, is the birth of all beings! Sarvayonishu kaunteya moortayah sambhavanti yaah; Taasaam brahma mahadyonir aham beejapradah pitaa. . Whatever forms are produced, O Arjuna, in any womb whatsoever, the great Brahma is their womb and I am the seed-giving father. Sattwam rajastama iti gunaah prakriti sambhavaah; Nibadhnanti mahaabaaho dehe dehinam avyayam. . Purity, passion and inertiathese qualities, O mighty-armed Arjuna, born of Nature, bind fast in the body, the embodied, the indestructible! COMMENTARY: The three Gunas are present in all human beings. None is free from the operation of any one of the three qualities. They are not constant. Sometimes Sattwa predominates and at other times Rajas or Tamas predominates. One should analyse and stand as a witness of these three qualities. Tatra sattwam nirmalatwaat prakaashakam anaamayam; Sukhasangena badhnaati jnaanasangena chaanagha. . Of these, Sattwa, which from its stainlessness is luminous and healthy, binds by attachment to knowledge and to happiness, O sinless one! Rajo raagaatmakam viddhi trishnaasangasamudbhavam; Tannibadhnaati kaunteya karmasangena dehinam. . Know thou Rajas to be of the nature of passion, the source of thirst for sensual enjoyment and attachment; it binds fast, O Arjuna, the embodied one by attachment to action! Tamastwajnaanajam viddhi mohanam sarvadehinaam; Pramaadaalasyanidraabhis tannibadhnaati bhaarata. . But know thou Tamas to be born of ignorance, deluding all embodied beings; it binds fast, O Arjuna, by heedlessness, sleep and indolence! Sattwam sukhe sanjayati rajah karmani bhaarata; Jnaanamaavritya tu tamah pramaade sanjayatyuta. . Sattwa attaches to happiness, Rajas to action, O Arjuna, while Tamas, shrouding knowledge, attaches to heedlessness only! Rajastamashchaabhibhooya sattwam bhavati bhaarata; Rajah sattwam tamashchaiva tamah sattwam rajastathaa. . Now Sattwa prevails, O Arjuna, having overpowered Rajas and Tamas; now Rajas, having overpowered Sattwa and Tamas; and now Tamas, having overpowered Sattwa and Rajas! Sarvadwaareshu dehesmin prakaasha upajaayate; Jnaanam yadaa tadaa vidyaa dvivriddham sattwamityuta. . When, through every gate sense in this body, the wisdom-light shines, then it may be known that Sattwa is predominant. Lobhah pravrittir aarambhah karmanaam ashamah sprihaa; Rajasyetaani jaayante vivriddhe bharatarshabha. . Greed, activity, the undertaking of actions, restlessness, longingthese arise when Rajas is predominant, O Arjuna! Aprakaashopravrittishcha pramaado moha eva cha; Tamasyetaani jaayante vivriddhe kurunandana. . Darkness, inertness, heedlessness and delusionthese arise when Tamas is predominant, O Arjuna! Yadaa sattwe pravriddhe tu pralayam yaati dehabhrit; Tadottamavidaam lokaan amalaan pratipadyate. . If the embodied one meets with death when Sattwa has become predominant, then he attains to the spotless worlds of the knowers of the Highest. Rajasi pralayam gatwaa karmasangishu jaayate; Tathaa praleenastamasi moodhayonishu jaayate. . Meeting death in Rajas, he is born among those who are attached to action; and dying in Tamas, he is born in the womb of the senseless. Karmanah sukritasyaahuh saattwikam nirmalam phalam; Rajasastu phalam duhkham ajnaanam tamasah phalam. . The fruit of good action, they say, is Sattwic and pure; the fruit of Rajas is pain, and ignorance is the fruit of Tamas. Sattwaat sanjaayate jnaanam rajaso lobha eva cha; Pramaadamohau tamaso bhavatojnaanameva cha. . From Sattwa arises knowledge, and greed from Rajas; heedlessness and delusion arise from Tamas, and ignorance also. Oordhwam gacchanti sattwasthaa madhye tishthanti raajasaah; Jaghanyagunavrittisthaa adho gacchanti taamasaah. . Those who are seated in Sattwa proceed upwards; the Rajasic dwell in the middle; and the Tamasic, abiding in the function of the lowest Guna, go downwards. Naanyam gunebhyah kartaaram yadaa drashtaanupashyati; Gunebhyashcha param vetti madbhaavam sodhigacchati. . When the seer beholds no agent other than the Gunas, knowing that which is higher than them, he attains to My Being. COMMENTARY: The seer knows that the Gunas alone are responsible for all actions and He is distinct from them. Gunaanetaanateetya treen dehee dehasamudbhavaan; Janmamrityujaraaduhkhair vimuktomritamashnute. . The embodied one, having crossed beyond these three Gunas out of which the body is evolved, is freed from birth, death, decay and pain, and attains to immortality. Arjuna Uvaacha: Kairlingais treen gunaanetaan ateeto bhavati prabho; Kimaachaarah katham chaitaam streen gunaan ativartate. Arjuna said: . What are the marks of him who has crossed over the three qualities, O Lord? What is his conduct and how does he go beyond these three qualities? Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha: Prakaasham cha pravrittim cha mohameva cha paandava; Na dweshti sampravrittaani na nivrittaani kaangkshati. The Blessed Lord said: . Light, activity and delusion,when they are present, O Arjuna, he hates not, nor does he long for them when they are absent! Udaaseenavadaaseeno gunairyo na vichaalyate; Gunaa vartanta ityeva yovatishthati nengate. . He who, seated like one unconcerned, is not moved by the qualities, and who, knowing that the qualities are active, is self-centred and moves not, Samaduhkhasukhah swasthah samaloshtaashmakaanchanah; Tulyapriyaapriyo dheeras tulyanindaatma samstutih. . Alike in pleasure and pain, who dwells in the Self, to whom a clod of earth, stone and gold are alike, to whom the dear and the unfriendly are alike, firm, the same in censure and praise, Maanaapamaanayostulyas tulyo mitraaripakshayoh; Sarvaarambhaparityaagee gunaateetah sa uchyate. . The same in honour and dishonour, the same to friend and foe, abandoning all undertakingshe is said to have crossed the qualities. Maam cha yovyabhichaarena bhaktiyogena sevate; Sa gunaan samateetyaitaan brahmabhooyaaya kalpate. . And he who serves Me with unswerving devotion, he, crossing beyond the qualities, is fit for becoming Brahman. Brahmano hi pratishthaaham amritasyaavyayasya cha; Shaashwatasya cha dharmasya sukhasyaikaantikasya cha. . For I am the abode of Brahman, the immortal and the immutable, of everlasting Dharma and of absolute bliss. Hari Om Tat Sat Iti Srimad Bhagavadgeetaasoopanishatsu Brahmavidyaayaam Yogashaastre Sri Krishnaarjunasamvaade Gunatrayavibhaagayogo Naama Chaturdashodhyaayah Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita, the science of the Eternal, the scripture of Yoga, the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna, ends the fourteenth discourse entitled: The Yoga of the Division Of the Three Gunas XV The Yoga of the Supreme Spirit Summary of Fifteenth Discourse This discourse is entitled Purushottama Yoga or the Yoga of the Supreme Person. Here Lord Krishna tells us about the ultimate source of this visible phenomenal universe from which all things have come into being, just like a great tree with all its roots, trunk, branches, twigs, leaves, flowers and fruits which spring forth from the earth, which itself supports the tree and in which it is rooted. Sri Krishna declares that the Supreme Being is the source of all existence, and refers allegorically to this universe as being like an inverted tree whose roots are in Para Brahman, and whose spreading branches and foliage constitute all the things and factors that go to make up this creation of variegated phenomena. This is a very mysterious Tree which is very difficult to understand, being a product of His inscrutable power of Maya; and hence a marvellous, apparent appearance without having actual reality. One who fully understands the nature of this Samsara-Tree goes beyond Maya. To be attached to it is to be caught in it. The surest way of transcending this Samsara or worldly life is by wielding the excellent weapon of dispassion and non-attachment. In verses four and five of this discourse the Lord tells us how one goes beyond this visible Samsara and attains the supreme, imperishable status, attaining which one does not have to return to this mortal world of pain and death. Lord Krishna also describes for us the wonderful mystery of His Presence in this universe and the supreme place He occupies in sustaining everything here. The Lord declares that it is a part of Himself that manifests here as the individual soul in each body. He Himself is the indwelling Oversoul beyond the self. He is the effulgence inherent in the sun, moon and fire. He is present as the nourishing element in the earth. He is the inner witness of all beings. He is the supreme Knower even beyond Vedic knowledge. He is the resplendent Person who is beyond both this perishable phenomenal creation as well as the imperishable individual soul which is a part of His eternal essence. Thus, because He is beyond perishable matter and superior to the imperishable soul enveloped in Maya, He is known in this world as well as in the Vedas as the Supreme Person. Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha: Oordhwamoolam adhahshaakham ashwattham praahuravyayam; Cchandaamsi yasya parnaani yastam veda sa vedavit. The Blessed Lord said: . They the wise speak of the indestructible peepul tree, having its root above and branches below, whose leaves are the metres or hymns; he who knows it is a knower of the Vedas. Adhashchordhwam prasritaastasya shaakhaah Gunapravriddhaa vishayapravaalaah; Adhashcha moolaanyanusantataani Karmaanubandheeni manushyaloke. . Below and above spread its branches, nourished by the Gunas; sense-objects are its buds; and below in the world of men stretch forth the roots, originating action. Na roopamasyeha tathopalabhyate Naanto na chaadirna cha sampratishthaa; Ashwatthamenam suviroodhamoolam Asangashastrena dridhena cchittwaa. . Its form is not perceived here as such, neither its end nor its origin, nor its foundation nor resting place; having cut asunder this firmly-rooted peepul tree with the strong axe of non-attachment, Tatah padam tat parimaargitavyam Yasmin gataa na nivartanti bhooyah; Tameva chaadyam purusham prapadye Yatah pravrittih prasritaa puraanee. . Then that goal should be sought after, whither having gone none returns again. Seek refuge in that Primeval Purusha whence streamed forth the ancient activity or energy. COMMENTARY: That which fills the whole world with the form of Satchidananda, is Purusha. That which sleeps in this city of the body is the Purusha. Single-minded devotion, which consists of ceaselessly remembering the Supreme Being, is the surest and most potent means of attaining Self-realisation. Nirmaanamohaa jitasangadoshaa Adhyaatmanityaa vinivrittakaamaah; Dwandwairvimuktaah sukhaduhkhasamjnair Gacchantyamoodhaah padamavyayam tat. . Free from pride and delusion, victorious over the evil of attachment, dwelling constantly in the Self, their desires having completely turned away, freed from the pairs of opposites known as pleasure and pain, the undeluded reach the eternal goal. Na tadbhaasayate sooryo na shashaangko na paavakah; Yadgatwaa na nivartante taddhaama paramam mama. . Neither doth the sun illumine there, nor the moon, nor the fire; having gone thither they return not; that is My supreme abode. Mamaivaamsho jeevaloke jeevabhootah sanaatanah; Manah shashthaaneendriyaani prakritisthaani karshati. . An eternal portion of Myself having become a living soul in the world of life, draws to itself the five senses with the mind for the sixth, abiding in Nature. Shareeram yadavaapnoti yacchaapyutkraamateeshwarah; Griheetwaitaani samyaati vaayurgandhaanivaashayaat. . When the Lord obtains a body and when He leaves it, He takes these and goes with them as the wind takes the scents from their seats flowers, etc.. Shrotram chakshuh sparshanam cha rasanam ghraanameva cha; Adhishthaaya manashchaayam vishayaanupasevate. . Presiding over the ear, the eye, touch, taste and smell, as well as the mind, he enjoys the objects of the senses. Utkraamantam sthitam vaapi bhunjaanam vaa gunaanvitam; Vimoodhaa naanupashyanti pashyanti jnaanachakshushah. . The deluded do not see Him who departs, stays and enjoys; but they who possess the eye of knowledge behold Him. Yatanto yoginashchainam pashyantyaatmanyavasthitam; Yatantopyakritaatmaano nainam pashyantyachetasah. . The Yogis striving for perfection behold Him dwelling in the Self; but, the unrefined and unintelligent, even though striving, see Him not. Yadaadityagatam tejo jagad bhaasayatekhilam; Yacchandramasi yacchaagnau tattejo viddhi maamakam. . That light which residing in the sun, illumines the whole world, that which is in the moon and in the fireknow that light to be Mine. Gaam aavishya cha bhootaani dhaarayaamyaham ojasaa; Pushnaami chaushadheeh sarvaah somo bhootwaa rasaatmakah. . Permeating the earth I support all beings by My energy; and, having become the watery moon, I nourish all herbs. Aham vaishwaanaro bhootwaa praaninaam dehamaashritah; Praanaapaana samaayuktah pachaamyannam chaturvidham. . Having become the fire Vaisvanara, I abide in the body of living beings and, associated with the Prana and Apana, digest the fourfold food. Sarvasya chaaham hridi sannivishto Mattah smritir jnaanam apohanam cha; Vedaischa sarvairahameva vedyo Vedaantakrid vedavid eva chaaham. . And, I am seated in the hearts of all; from Me are memory, knowledge, as well as their absence. I am verily that which has to be known by all the Vedas; I am indeed the author of the Vedanta, and the knower of the Vedas am I. Dwaavimau purushau loke ksharashchaakshara eva cha; Ksharah sarvaani bhootaani kootasthokshara uchyate. . Two Purushas there are in this world, the perishable and the imperishable. All beings are the perishable, and the Kutastha is called the imperishable. Uttamah purushastwanyah paramaatmetyudaahritah; Yo lokatrayamaavishya bibhartyavyaya ishwarah. . But distinct is the Supreme Purusha called the highest Self, the indestructible Lord who, pervading the three worlds, sustains them. Yasmaat ksharam ateetohamaksharaadapi chottamah; Atosmi loke vede cha prathitah purushottamah. . As I transcend the perishable and am even higher than the imperishable, I am declared as the highest Purusha in the world and in the Vedas. Yo maamevam asammoodho jaanaati purushottamam; Sa sarvavidbhajati maam sarvabhaavena bhaarata. . He who, undeluded, knows Me thus as the highest Purusha, he, knowing all, worships Me with his whole being heart, O Arjuna! Iti guhyatamam shaastram idamuktam mayaanagha; Etadbuddhwaa buddhimaan syaat kritakrityashcha bhaarata. . Thus, this most secret science has been taught by Me, O sinless one! On knowing this, a man becomes wise, and all his duties are accomplished, O Arjuna! Hari Om Tat Sat Iti Srimad Bhagavadgeetaasoopanishatsu Brahmavidyaayaam Yogashaastre Sri Krishnaarjunasamvaade Purushottamayogo Naama Panchadashodhyaayah Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita, the science of the Eternal, the scripture of Yoga, the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna, ends the fifteenth discourse entitled: The Yoga of the Supreme Spirit XVI The Yoga of the Division Between the Divine and the Demoniacal Summary of Sixteenth Discourse This discourse is important and very instructive to all persons who wish to attain happiness, prosperity and blessedness, and to seekers in particular, who wish to attain success in their spiritual life. Lord Krishna brings out quite clearly and unmistakably here the intimate connection between ethics and spirituality, between a life of virtue and God-realisation and liberation. Listing two sets of qualities of opposite kinds, the Lord classifies them as divine and demoniacal undivine, and urges us to eradicate the latter and cultivate the divine qualities. What kind of nature should one develop? What conduct must one follow? What way should one live and act if one must attain God and obtain divine bliss? These questions are answered with perfect clarity and very definitely. The pure divine qualities are conducive to peace and liberation and the undivine qualities lead to bondage. Purity, good conduct and truth are indispensable to spiritual progress and even to an honourable life here. Devoid of purity, good conduct and truth, and having no faith in God or a higher Reality beyond this visible world, man degenerates into a two-legged beast of ugly character and cruel actions, and sinks into darkness. Such a person becomes his own enemy and the destroyer of the happiness of others as well as his own. Caught in countless desires and cravings, a slave of sensual enjoyments and beset by a thousand cares, his life ultimately ends in misery and degradation. Haughtiness, arrogance and egoism lead to this dire fate. Therefore, a wise person, desiring success, must eradicate vice and cultivate virtue. In this world three gates lead to hellthe gates of passion, anger and greed. Released from these three qualities one can succeed in attaining salvation and reaching the highest goal, namely God. Thus the sacred scriptures teach wisely the right path of pure, virtuous living. One should therefore follow the injunctions of the sacred scriptures that wish his welfare and be guided in his actions by their noble teachings. Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha: Abhayam sattwasamshuddhih jnaanayogavyavasthitih; Daanam damashcha yajnashcha swaadhyaayastapa aarjavam. The Blessed Lord said: . Fearlessness, purity of heart, steadfastness in Yoga and knowledge, alms-giving, control of the senses, sacrifice, study of scriptures, austerity and straightforwardness, Ahimsaa satyamakrodhas tyaagah shaantirapaishunam; Dayaa bhooteshvaloluptwam maardavam hreerachaapalam. . Harmlessness, truth, absence of anger, renunciation, peacefulness, absence of crookedness, compassion towards beings, uncovetousness, gentleness, modesty, absence of fickleness, Tejah kshamaa dhritih shauchamadroho naatimaanitaa; Bhavanti sampadam daiveem abhijaatasya bhaarata. . Vigour, forgiveness, fortitude, purity, absence of hatred, absence of pridethese belong to one born in a divine state, O Arjuna! Dambho darpobhimaanashcha krodhah paarushyameva cha; Ajnaanam chaabhijaatasya paartha sampadamaasureem. . Hypocrisy, arrogance, self-conceit, harshness and also anger and ignorance, belong to one who is born in a demoniacal state, O Arjuna! Daivee sampadvimokshaaya nibandhaayaasuree mataa; Maa shuchah sampadam daiveem abhijaatosi paandava. . The divine nature is deemed for liberation and the demoniacal for bondage. Grieve not, O Arjuna, for thou art born with divine properties! COMMENTARY: As Arjuna is dejected, Sri Krishna assures him not to feel alarmed at this description of the demoniacal qualities as he is born with Sattwic tendencies leading towards salvation. Dwau bhootasargau lokesmin daiva aasura eva cha; Daivo vistarashah proktah aasuram paartha me shrinu. . There are two types of beings in this worldthe divine and the demoniacal; the divine has been described at length; hear from Me, O Arjuna, of the demoniacal! Pravrittim cha nivrittim cha janaa na viduraasuraah; Na shaucham naapi chaachaaro na satyam teshu vidyate. . The demoniacal know not what to do and what to refrain from; neither purity nor right conduct nor truth is found in them. Asatyamapratishtham te jagadaahuraneeshwaram; Aparasparasambhootam kimanyat kaamahaitukam. . They say: This universe is without truth, without a moral basis, without a God, brought about by mutual union, with lust for its cause; what else? Etaam drishtimavashtabhya nashtaatmaanolpabuddhayah; Prabhavantyugrakarmaanah kshayaaya jagatohitaah. . Holding this view, these ruined souls of small intellects and fierce deeds, come forth as enemies of the world for its destruction. Kaamamaashritya dushpooram dambhamaanamadaanvitaah; Mohaadgriheetvaasadgraahaan pravartanteshuchivrataah. . Filled with insatiable desires, full of hypocrisy, pride and arrogance, holding evil ideas through delusion, they work with impure resolves. Chintaamaparimeyaam cha pralayaantaamupaashritaah; Kaamopabhogaparamaa etaavaditi nishchitaah. . Giving themselves over to immeasurable cares ending only with death, regarding gratification of lust as their highest aim, and feeling sure that that is all, Aashaapaashashatairbaddhaah kaamakrodhaparaayanaah; Eehante kaamabhogaartha manyaayenaarthasanchayaan. . Bound by a hundred ties of hope, given over to lust and anger, they strive to obtain by unlawful means hoards of wealth for sensual enjoyment. Idamadya mayaa labdham imam praapsye manoratham; Idamasteedamapi me bhavishyati punardhanam. . This has been gained by me today; this desire I shall obtain; this is mine and this wealth too shall be mine in future. Asau mayaa hatah shatrur hanishye chaaparaanapi; Eeshwarohamaham bhogee siddhoham balavaan sukhee. . That enemy has been slain by me and others also I shall slay. I am the lord; I enjoy; I am perfect, powerful and happy. Aadhyobhijanavaanasmi konyosti sadrisho mayaa; Yakshye daasyaami modishye ityajnaanavimohitaah. . I am rich and born in a noble family. Who else is equal to me? I will sacrifice. I will give charity. I will rejoice,thus, deluded by ignorance, Anekachittavibhraantaah mohajaalasamaavritaah; Prasaktaah kaamabhogeshu patanti narakeshuchau. . Bewildered by many a fancy, entangled in the snare of delusion, addicted to the gratification of lust, they fall into a foul hell. Aatmasambhaavitaah stabdhaa dhanamaanamadaanvitaah; Yajante naamayajnaiste dambhenaavidhipoorvakam. . Self-conceited, stubborn, filled with the intoxication and pride of wealth, they perform sacrifices in name, through ostentation, contrary to scriptural ordinances. Ahankaaram balam darpam kaamam krodham cha samshritaah; Maamaatmaparadeheshu pradwishantobhyasooyakaah. . Given over to egoism, power, haughtiness, lust and anger, these malicious people hate Me in their own bodies and those of others. Taanaham dwishatah krooraan samsaareshu naraadhamaan; Kshipaamyajasram ashubhaan aasureeshweva yonishu. . These cruel haters, the worst among men in the world,I hurl all these evil-doers for ever into the wombs of demons only. Aasureem yonimaapannaa moodhaa janmani janmani; Maamapraapyaiva kaunteya tato yaantyadhamaam gatim. . Entering into demoniacal wombs and deluded birth after birth, not attaining Me, they thus fall, O Arjuna, into a condition still lower than that! Trividham narakasyedam dwaaram naashanamaatmanah; Kaamah krodhastathaa lobhas tasmaadetat trayam tyajet. . Triple is the gate of this hell, destructive of the selflust, anger, and greed,therefore, one should abandon these three. Etairvimuktah kaunteya tamodwaaraistribhirnarah; Aacharatyaatmanah shreyas tato yaati paraam gatim. . A man who is liberated from these three gates to darkness, O Arjuna, practises what is good for him and thus goes to the Supreme goal! COMMENTARY: When these three gates to hell are abandoned, the path to salvation is cleared for the aspirant. He gets the company of sages, which leads to liberation. He receives spiritual instructions and practises them. He hears the scriptures, reflects, meditates and attains Self-realisation. Yah shaastravidhimutsrijya vartate kaamakaaratah; Na sa siddhimavaapnoti na sukham na paraam gatim. . He who, casting aside the ordinances of the scriptures, acts under the impulse of desire, attains neither perfection nor happiness nor the supreme goal. Tasmaat shaastram pramaanam te kaaryaakaaryavyavasthitau; Jnaatwaa shaastravidhaanoktam karma kartumihaarhasi. . Therefore, let the scripture be the authority in determining what ought to be done and what ought not to be done. Having known what is said in the ordinance of the scriptures, thou shouldst act here in this world. Hari Om Tat Sat Iti Srimad Bhagavadgeetaasoopanishatsu Brahmavidyaayaam Yogashaastre Sri Krishnaarjunasamvaade Daivaasurasampadvibhaagayogo Naama Shodashodhyaayah Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita, the science of the Eternal, the scripture of Yoga, the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna, ends the sixteenth discourse entitled: The Yoga of the Division Between the Divine the Demoniacal XVII The Yoga of the Division of the Threefold Faith Summary of Seventeenth Discourse This discourse is termed the Yoga of the Division of the Three Kinds of Faith. The theme of this discourse arises out of the question asked by Arjuna in Verse with reference to the final and closing advice of Lord Krishna in the previous discourse, contained in the last two verses therein Verses and . Arjuna asks, What about those who, even though setting aside scriptural injunctions yet perform worship with faith? The Lord replies and states that the faith of such men who ignore the injunctions of the scriptures could be either Sattwic, Rajasic or Tamasic. This would be in accordance with the basic nature of the person himself. And, conversely, as is the kind of faith, so develops the nature of the man. Thus, in all things like sacrifice, worship, charity, penance, etc., these qualities become expressed in accordance with the kind of faith in which the person concerned is based. They produce results in accordance with the quality of the doers faith. These acts done with right faith lead to supreme blessedness. When done without any faith whatsoever, all these actions become barren and useless. Arjuna Uvaacha: Ye shaastravidhimutsrijya yajante shraddhayaanvitaah; Teshaam nishthaa tu kaa krishna sattwamaaho rajastamah. Arjuna said: . Those who, setting aside the ordinances of the scriptures, perform sacrifice with faith, what is their condition, O Krishna? Is it that of Sattwa, Rajas or Tamas? COMMENTARY: This discourse deals with the three kinds of faith, according to ones inherent natureSattwic, Rajasic or Tamasic. Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha: Trividhaa bhavati shraddhaa dehinaam saa swabhaavajaa; Saattwikee raajasee chaiva taamasee cheti taam shrinu. The Blessed Lord said: . Threefold is the faith of the embodied, which is inherent in their naturethe Sattwic pure, the Rajasic passionate, and the Tamasic dark. Do thou hear of it. Sattwaanuroopaa sarvasya shraddhaa bhavati bhaarata; Shraddhaamayoyam purusho yo yacchraddhah sa eva sah. . The faith of each is in accordance with his nature, O Arjuna! The man consists of his faith; as a mans faith is, so is he. Yajante saattwikaa devaan yaksharakshaamsi raajasaah; Pretaan bhootaganaamshchaanye yajante taamasaa janaah. . The Sattwic or pure men worship the gods; the Rajasic or the passionate worship the Yakshas and the Rakshasas; the others the Tamasic or the deluded worship the ghosts and the hosts of nature-spirits. Ashaastravihitam ghoram tapyante ye tapo janaah; Dambhaahamkaarasamyuktaah kaamaraagabalaanvitaah. . Those men who practise terrific austerities not enjoined by the scriptures, given to hypocrisy and egoism, impelled by the force of lust and attachment, Karshayantah shareerastham bhootagraamamachetasah; Maam chaivaantahshareerastham taanviddhyaasuranishchayaan. . Senseless, torturing all the elements in the body and Me also, who dwells in the body,know thou these to be of demoniacal resolves. Aahaarastwapi sarvasya trividho bhavati priyah; Yajnastapastathaa daanam teshaam bhedamimam shrinu. . The food also which is dear to each is threefold, as also sacrifice, austerity and alms-giving. Hear thou the distinction of these. COMMENTARY: A mans taste for a particular food is determined according to the Guna prevalent in him. Aayuh sattwabalaarogya sukha preetivi vardhanaah; Rasyaah snigdhaah sthiraa hridyaa aahaaraah saattwikapriyaah. . Foods which increase life, purity, strength, health,joy and cheerfulness, which are oleaginous and savoury, substantial and agreeable, are dear to the Sattwic people. Katvamlalavanaatyushna teekshna rooksha vidaahinah; Aahaaraah raajasasyeshtaa duhkhashokaamayapradaah. . The foods that are bitter, sour, saline, excessively hot, dry, pungent and burning, are liked by the Rajasic and are productive of pain, grief and disease. Yaatayaamam gatarasam pooti paryushitam cha yat; Ucchishtamapi chaamedhyam bhojanam taamasapriyam. . That which is stale, tasteless, putrid, rotten and impure refuse, is the food liked by the Tamasic. Aphalaakaangkshibhiryajno vidhidrishto ya ijyate; Yashtavyameveti manah samaadhaaya sa saattwikah. . That sacrifice which is offered by men without desire for reward as enjoined by the ordinance scripture, with a firm faith that to do so is a duty, is Sattwic or pure. Abhisandhaaya tu phalam dambhaarthamapi chaiva yat; Ijyate bharatashreshtha tam yajnam viddhi raajasam. . The sacrifice which is offered, O Arjuna, seeking a reward and for ostentation, know thou that to be a Rajasic Yajna! Vidhiheenam asrishtaannam mantraheenam adakshinam; Shraddhaavirahitam yajnam taamasam parichakshate. . They declare that sacrifice to be Tamasic which is contrary to the ordinances of the scriptures, in which no food is distributed, which is devoid of Mantras and gifts, and which is devoid of faith. Devadwijagurupraajna poojanam shauchamaarjavam; Brahmacharyamahimsaa cha shaareeram tapa uchyate. . Worship of the gods, the twice-born, the teachers and the wise, purity, straightforwardness, celibacy and non-injurythese are called the austerities of the body. Anudwegakaram vaakyam satyam priyahitam cha yat; Swaadhyaayaabhyasanam chaiva vaangmayam tapa uchyate. . Speech which causes no excitement and is truthful, pleasant and beneficial, the practice of the study of the Vedas, are called austerity of speech. COMMENTARY: It is said in the Manu Smriti: One should speak what is true; one should speak what is pleasant; one should not speak what is true if it is not pleasant, nor what is pleasant if it is false. This is the ancient Dharma. To be an austerity speech should combine all the attributes mentioned in the above verse. Manahprasaadah saumyatwam maunamaatmavinigrahah; Bhaavasamshuddhirityetat tapo maanasamuchyate. . Serenity of mind, good-heartedness, purity of nature, self-controlthis is called mental austerity. Shraddhayaa parayaa taptam tapastattrividham naraih; Aphalaakaangkshibhiryuktaih saattwikam parichakshate. . This threefold austerity practised by steadfast men with the utmost faith, desiring no reward, they call Sattwic. Satkaaramaanapoojaartham tapo dambhena chaiva yat; Kriyate tadiha proktam raajasam chalamadhruvam. . The austerity which is practised with the object of gaining good reception, honour and worship and with hypocrisy, is here said to be Rajasic, unstable and transitory. Moodhagraahenaatmano yat peedayaa kriyate tapah; Parasyotsaadanaartham vaa tattaamasamudaahritam. . The austerity which is practised out of a foolish notion, with self-torture, or for the purpose of destroying another, is declared to be Tamasic. Daatavyamiti yaddaanam deeyatenupakaarine; Deshe kaale cha paatre cha taddaanam saattwikam smritam. . That gift which is given to one who does nothing in return, knowing it to be a duty to give in a fit place and time to a worthy person, that gift is held to be Sattwic. Yattu pratyupakaaraartham phalamuddishya vaa punah; Deeyate cha pariklishtam taddaanam raajasam smritam. . And, that gift which is made with a view to receive something in return, or looking for a reward, or given reluctantly, is said to be Rajasic. Adeshakaale yaddaanamapaatrebhyashcha deeyate; Asatkritamavajnaatam tattaamasamudaahritam. . The gift which is given at the wrong place and time to unworthy persons, without respect or with insult, is declared to be Tamasic. COMMENTARY: At the wrong place and timeat a place which is not holy, where irreligious people and beggars assemble, where wealth acquired through illegal means such as gambling and theft, is distributed to gamblers, singers, fools, rogues, women of evil reputation; wealth that is distributed at an inauspicious time. This does not discourage the giving of alms to the poor. Om tatsaditi nirdesho brahmanas trividhah smritah; Braahmanaastena vedaashcha yajnaashcha vihitaah puraa. . Om Tat Sat: this has been declared to be the triple designation of Brahman. By that were created formerly the Brahmanas, the Vedas and the sacrifices. Tasmaadomityudaahritya yajnadaanatapahkriyaah; Pravartante vidhaanoktaah satatam brahmavaadinaam. . Therefore, with the utterance of Om are the acts of gift, sacrifice and austerity as enjoined in the scriptures always begun by the students of Brahman. Tadityanabhisandhaaya phalam yajnatapah kriyaah; Daanakriyaashcha vividhaah kriyante mokshakaangkshibhih. . Uttering Tat, without aiming at the fruits, are the acts of sacrifice and austerity and the various acts of gift performed by the seekers of liberation. Sadbhaave saadhubhaave cha sadityetatprayujyate; Prashaste karmani tathaa sacchabdah paartha yujyate. . The word Sat is used in the sense of reality and of goodness; and so also, O Arjuna, it is used in the sense of an auspicious act! Yajne tapasi daane cha sthitih saditi chochyate; Karma chaiva tadartheeyam sadityevaabhidheeyate. . Steadfastness in sacrifice, austerity and gift, is also called Sat, and also action in connection with these or for the sake of the Supreme is called Sat. Ashraddhayaa hutam dattam tapastaptam kritam cha yat; Asadityuchyate paartha na cha tatpretya no iha. . Whatever is sacrificed, given or performed, and whatever austerity is practised without faith, it is called Asat, O Arjuna! It is naught here or hereafter after death. COMMENTARY: Whatever sacrifice, austerity or charity done without being dedicated to the Lord will be of no avail to the doer in this earthly life here or in the life beyond hereafter. Hari Om Tat Sat Iti Srimad Bhagavadgeetaasoopanishatsu Brahmavidyaayaam Yogashaastre Sri Krishnaarjunasamvaade Shraddhaatrayavibhaagayogo Naama Saptadashodhyaayah Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita, the science of the Eternal, the scripture of Yoga, the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna, ends the seventeenth discourse entitled: The Yoga of the Division of the Threefold Faith XVIII The Yoga of Liberation by Renunciation Summary of Eighteenth Discourse The eighteenth discourse, which is the conclusion of the divine discourse of Lord Krishna, is in many ways a summary of the foregoing portions of the Gita. It covers in brief numerous important points dealt with in the previous discourses. Here you behold the ultimate result or effect of the Lords discourse to Arjuna. The drama of Arjunas utter despondency and breakdown is finally resolved in triumphant self-mastery, strength and bold resoluteness. Its central message emerges as an assurance that in and through the performance of ones respective duties in life one can qualify for the highest liberation, if one performs actions by renouncing egoism and attachment and surrendering all desire for selfish, personal gain. By regarding the performance of your duties as worship offered to God, you obtain the Grace of the Lord and attain the eternal One. Significantly, this discourse opens with a question by Arjuna asking what is true Sannyasa and true Tyaga renunciation. In reply to this important and crucial query, the blessed Lord makes it clear to us that real Sannyasa or renunciation lies in renunciation of selfish actions, and even more in the renunciation of the desire or greed for the fruits of any action. Very clearly we are told that selfless and virtuous actions, and actions conducive to the welfare of others should not be abandoned. You must engage yourself in performing such action but renouncing attachment and greed. The true and proper renunciation is giving up of selfishness and attachment while performing ones legitimate duties. This is called Sattwic Tyaga. We neither hate unpleasant action nor are we attached to pleasurable action. As it is not possible for you to renounce all action, the renunciation of egoism, selfishness and attachment in your activity is declared as true renunciation. Karma does not accumulate and bind one who is thus established in such inner renunciation. The divine injunction is that God must be made the sole object of ones life. This is the heart of the Gita gospel. This is the central message in its teaching. This is the one way to your welfare here. Now Sanjaya concludes his narrative by declaring that where there is such obedience as that of Arjuna, and such willing readiness to carry out the divine teachings, there surely prosperity, victory, glory and all blessedness will prevail. Arjuna Uvaacha: Sannyaasasya mahaabaaho tattwamicchaami veditum; Tyaagasya cha hrisheekesha prithak keshinishoodana. Arjuna said: . I desire to know severally, O mighty-armed, the essence or truth of renunciation, O Hrishikesa, as also of abandonment, O slayer of Kesi! Sri Bhagavaan Uvaacha: Kaamyaanaam karmanaam nyaasam sannyaasam kavayoviduh; Sarvakarmaphalatyaagam praahustyaagam vichakshanaah. The Blessed Lord said: . The sages understand Sannyas to be the renunciation of action with desire; the wise declare the abandonment of the fruits of all actions as Tyaga. Tyaajyam doshavadityeke karma praahurmaneeshinah; Yajnadaanatapah karma na tyaajyamiti chaapare. . Some philosophers declare that all actions should be abandoned as an evil, while others declare that acts of gift, sacrifice and austerity should not be relinquished. Nishchayam shrinu me tatra tyaage bharatasattama; Tyaago hi purushavyaaghra trividhah samprakeertitah. . Hear from Me the conclusion or the final truth about this abandonment, O best of the Bharatas; abandonment, verily, O best of men, has been declared to be of three kinds! Yajnadaanatapah karma na tyaajyam kaaryameva tat; Yajno daanam tapashchaiva paavanaani maneeshinaam. . Acts of sacrifice, gift and austerity should not be abandoned, but should be performed; sacrifice, gift and also austerity are the purifiers of the wise. Etaanyapi tu karmaani sangam tyaktwaa phalaani cha; Kartavyaaneeti me paartha nishchitam matamuttamam. . But even these actions should be performed leaving aside attachment and the desire for rewards, O Arjuna! This is My certain and best conviction. COMMENTARY: This is a summary of the doctrine of Karma Yoga already enunciated before. The defect in Karma is not in the action itself but in attachment and expectation of a reward. Niyatasya tu sannyaasah karmano nopapadyate; Mohaattasya parityaagas taamasah parikeertitah. . Verily, the renunciation of obligatory action is improper; the abandonment of the same from delusion is declared to be Tamasic. Duhkhamityeva yat karma kaayakleshabhayaat tyajet; Sa kritwaa raajasam tyaagam naiva tyaagaphalam labhet. . He who abandons action on account of the fear of bodily trouble because it is painful, he does not obtain the merit of renunciation by doing such Rajasic renunciation. Kaaryamityeva yatkarma niyatam kriyaterjuna; Sangam tyaktwaa phalam chaiva sa tyaagah saattwiko matah. . Whatever obligatory action is done, O Arjuna, merely because it ought to be done, abandoning attachment and also the desire for reward, that renunciation is regarded as Sattwic! Na dweshtyakushalam karma kushale naanushajjate; Tyaagee sattwasamaavishto medhaavee cchinnasamshayah. . The man of renunciation, pervaded by purity, intelligent and with his doubts cut asunder, does not hate a disagreeable work nor is he attached to an agreeable one. Na hi dehabhritaa shakyam tyaktum karmaanyasheshatah; Yastu karmaphalatyaagi sa tyaageetyabhidheeyate. . Verily, it is not possible for an embodied being to abandon actions entirely; but he who relinquishes the rewards of actions is verily called a man of renunciation. COMMENTARY: Nature, and your own nature, too, will urge you to do actions. You will have to abandon the idea of agency and the fruits of actions. Then no action will bind you. Anishtamishtam mishram cha trividham karmanah phalam; Bhavatyatyaaginaam pretya na tu sannyaasinaam kwachit. . The threefold fruit of actionevil, good and mixedaccrues after death to the non-abandoners, but never to the abandoners. Panchaitaani mahaabaaho kaaranaani nibodha me; Saankhye kritaante proktaani siddhaye sarvakarmanaam. . Learn from Me, O mighty-armed Arjuna, these five causes, as declared in the Sankhya system for the accomplishment of all actions! Adhishthaanam tathaa kartaa karanam cha prithagvidham; Vividhaashcha prithakcheshtaa daivam chaivaatra panchamam. . The body, the doer, the various senses, the different functions of various sorts, and the presiding Deity, also, the fifth, Shareeravaangmanobhiryat karma praarabhate narah; Nyaayyam vaa vipareetam vaa panchaite tasya hetavah. . Whatever action a man performs by his body, speech and mind, whether right or the reverse, these five are its causes. Tatraivam sati kartaaram aatmaanam kevalam tu yah; Pashyatyakritabuddhitwaan na sa pashyati durmatih. . Now, such being the case, he who, owing to untrained understanding, looks upon his Self, which is isolated, as the agent, he of perverted intelligence, sees not. Yasya naahankrito bhaavo buddhiryasya na lipyate; Hatwaapi sa imaam llokaan na hanti na nibadhyate. . He who is ever free from the egoistic notion, whose intelligence is not tainted by good or evil, though he slays these people, he slayeth not, nor is he bound by the action. Jnaanam jneyam parijnaataa trividhaa karmachodanaa; Karanam karma karteti trividhah karmasangrahah. . Knowledge, the knowable and the knower form the threefold impulse to action; the organ, the action and the agent form the threefold basis of action. Jnaanam karma cha kartaa cha tridhaiva gunabhedatah; Prochyate gunasankhyaane yathaavacchrinu taanyapi. . Knowledge, action and the actor are declared in the science of the Gunas the Sankhya philosophy to be of three kinds only, according to the distinction of the Gunas. Hear them also duly. Sarvabhooteshu yenaikam bhaavamavyayameekshate; Avibhaktam vibhakteshu tajjnaanam viddhi saattwikam. . That by which one sees the one indestructible Reality in all beings, not separate in all the separate beingsknow thou that knowledge to be Sattwic pure. Prithaktwena tu yajjnaanam naanaabhaavaan prithagvidhaan; Vetti sarveshu bhooteshu tajjnaanam viddhi raajasam. . But that knowledge which sees in all beings various entities of distinct kinds as different from one anotherknow thou that knowledge to be Rajasic passionate. Yattu kritsnavadekasmin kaarye saktamahaitukam; Atattwaarthavadalpam cha tattaamasamudaahritam. . But that which clings to one single effect as if it were the whole, without reason, without foundation in Truth, and trivialthat is declared to be Tamasic dark. Niyatam sangarahitam araagadweshatah kritam; Aphalaprepsunaa karma yattat saattwikamuchyate. . An action which is ordained, which is free from attachment, which is done without love or hatred by one who is not desirous of any rewardthat action is declared to be Sattwic. Yattu kaamepsunaa karma saahankaarena vaa punah; Kriyate bahulaayaasam tadraajasamudaahritam. . But that action which is done by one longing for the fulfilment of desires or gain, with egoism or with much effortthat is declared to be Rajasic. Anubandham kshayam himsaam anavekshya cha paurusham; Mohaadaarabhyate karma yattat taamasamuchyate. . That action which is undertaken from delusion, without regard to the consequences of loss, injury and ones own abilitythat is declared to be Tamasic. Muktasangonahamvaadi dhrityutsaahasamanvitah; Siddhyasiddhyor nirvikaarah kartaa saattwika uchyate. . He who is free from attachment, non-egoistic, endowed with firmness and enthusiasm and unaffected by success or failure, is called Sattwic. Raagee karmaphalaprepsur lubdho himsaatmakoshuchih; Harshashokaanvitah kartaa raajasah parikeertitah. . Passionate, desiring to obtain the rewards of actions, cruel, greedy, impure, moved by joy and sorrow, such an agent is said to be Rajasic. Ayuktah praakritah stabdhah shatho naishkritikolasah; Vishaadee deerghasootree cha kartaa taamasa uchyate. . Unsteady, dejected, unbending, cheating, malicious, vulgar, lazy and proscrastinatingsuch an agent is called Tamasic. Buddherbhedam dhriteshchaiva gunatastrividham shrinu; Prochyamaanamasheshena prithaktwena dhananjaya. . Hear thou the threefold division of the intellect and firmness according to the Gunas, as I declare them fully and distinctly, O Arjuna! Pravrittim cha nivrittim cha karyaakaarye bhayaabhaye; Bandhammoksham cha yaa vetti buddhih saa paartha saattwikee. . That which knows the path of work and renunciation, what ought to be done and what ought not to be done, fear and fearlessness, bondage and liberationthat intellect is Sattwic, O Arjuna! Yayaa dharmamadharmam cha kaaryam chaakaaryameva cha; Ayathaavat prajaanaati buddhih saa paartha raajasee. . That by which one incorrectly understands Dharma and Adharma, and also what ought to be done and what ought not to be donethat intellect, O Arjuna, is Rajasic! COMMENTARY: That which is ordained in the scriptures is Dharma. That which hurls you into the abyss of ignorance is Adharma. The Rajasic intellect is not able to distinguish between righteous and unrighteous actions. Adharmam dharmamiti yaa manyate tamasaavritaa; Sarvaarthaan vipareetaamshcha buddhih saa paartha taamasee. . That which, enveloped in darkness, views Adharma as Dharma and all things pervertedthat intellect, O Arjuna, is called Tamasic! Dhrityaa yayaa dhaarayate manah praanendriyakriyaah; Yogenaavyabhichaarinyaa dhritih saa paartha saattwikee. . The unwavering firmness by which, through Yoga, the functions of the mind, the life-force and the senses are restrainedthat firmness, O Arjuna, is Sattwic! Yayaa tu dharmakaamaarthaan dhrityaa dhaarayaterjuna; Prasangena phalaakaangkshee dhritih saa paartha raajasee. . But that firmness, O Arjuna, by which, on account of attachment and desire for reward, one holds fast to Dharma, enjoyment of pleasures and earning of wealththat firmness, O Arjuna, is Rajasic! Yayaa swapnam bhayam shokam vishaadam madameva cha; Na vimunchati durmedhaa dhritih saa paartha taamasee. . That by which a stupid man does not abandon sleep, fear, grief, despair and also conceitthat firmness, O Arjuna, is Tamasic! Sukham twidaaneem trividham shrinu me bharatarshabha; Abhyaasaadramate yatra duhkhaantam cha nigacchati. . Now hear from Me, O Arjuna, of the threefold pleasure, in which one rejoices by practice and surely comes to the end of pain! Yattadagre vishamiva parinaamemritopamam; Tatsukham saattwikam proktam aatmabuddhiprasaadajam. . That which is like poison at first but in the end like nectarthat pleasure is declared to be Sattwic, born of the purity of ones own mind due to Self-realisation. Vishayendriya samyogaad yattadagremritopamam; Parinaame vishamiva tatsukham raajasam smritam. . That pleasure which arises from the contact of the sense-organs with the objects, which is at first like nectar and in the end like poisonthat is declared to be Rajasic. Yadagre chaanubandhe cha sukham mohanamaatmanah; Nidraalasyapramaadottham tattaamasamudaahritam. . That pleasure which at first and in the sequel is delusive of the self, arising from sleep, indolence and heedlessnesssuch a pleasure is declared to be Tamasic. Na tadasti prithivyaam vaa divi deveshu vaa punah; Sattwam prakritijairmuktam yadebhih syaat tribhirgunaih. . There is no being on earth or again in heaven among the gods that is liberated from the three qualities born of Nature. Braahmanakshatriyavishaam shoodraanaam cha parantapa; Karmaani pravibhaktaani swabhaavaprabhavairgunaih. . Of Brahmanas, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas, as also the Sudras, O Arjuna, the duties are distributed according to the qualities born of their own nature! Shamo damastapah shaucham kshaantiraarjavameva cha; Jnaanam vijnaanam aastikyam brahmakarma swabhaavajam. . Serenity, self-restraint, austerity, purity, forgiveness and also uprightness, knowledge, realisation and belief in God are the duties of the Brahmanas, born of their own nature. Shauryam tejo dhritirdaakshyam yuddhe chaapyapalaayanam; Daanameeshwarabhaavashcha kshaatram karmaswabhaavajam. . Prowess, splendour, firmness, dexterity and also not fleeing from battle, generosity and lordliness are the duties of Kshatriyas, born of their own nature. Krishigaurakshyavaanijyam vaishyakarma swabhaavajam; Paricharyaatmakam karma shoodrasyaapi swabhaavajam. . Agriculture, cattle-rearing and trade are the duties of the Vaishya merchant class, born of their own nature; and action consisting of service is the duty of the Sudra servant class, born of their own nature. COMMENTARY: When a man does his duties rightly according to his order of life, his heart gets purified and he goes to heaven. Swe swe karmanyabhiratah samsiddhim labhate narah; Swakarmaniratah siddhim yathaa vindati tacchrinu. . Each man, devoted to his own duty, attains perfection. How he attains perfection while being engaged in his own duty, hear now. Yatah pravrittirbhootaanaam yena sarvamidam tatam; Swakarmanaa tamabhyarchya siddhim vindati maanavah. . He from whom all the beings have evolved and by whom all this is pervaded, worshipping Him with his own duty, man attains perfection. COMMENTARY: Man attains perfection by worshipping the Lord through the performance of his own duty, that is, he becomes qualified for the dawn of Self-knowledge. Shreyaanswadharmo vigunah paradharmaat swanushthitaat; Swabhaavaniyatam karma kurvannaapnoti kilbisham. . Better is ones own duty though destitute of merits, than the duty of another well performed. He who does the duty ordained by his own nature incurs no sin. Sahajam karma kaunteya sadoshamapi na tyajet; Sarvaarambhaa hi doshena dhoomenaagnirivaavritaah. . One should not abandon, O Arjuna, the duty to which one is born, though faulty; for, all undertakings are enveloped by evil, as fire by smoke! Asaktabuddhih sarvatra jitaatmaa vigatasprihah; Naishkarmyasiddhim paramaam sannyaasenaadhigacchati. . He whose intellect is unattached everywhere, who has subdued his self, from whom desire has fled,he by renunciation attains the supreme state of freedom from action. Siddhim praapto yathaa brahma tathaapnoti nibodha me; Samaasenaiva kaunteya nishthaa jnaanasya yaa paraa. . Learn from Me in brief, O Arjuna, how he who has attained perfection reaches Brahman, that supreme state of knowledge. Buddhyaa vishuddhayaa yukto dhrityaatmaanam niyamya cha; Shabdaadeen vishayaanstyaktwaa raagadweshau vyudasya cha. . Endowed with a pure intellect, controlling the self by firmness, relinquishing sound and other objects and abandoning both hatred and attraction, Viviktasevee laghwaashee yatavaakkaayamaanasah; Dhyaanayogaparo nityam vairaagyam samupaashritah. . Dwelling in solitude, eating but little, with speech, body and mind subdued, always engaged in concentration and meditation, taking refuge in dispassion, Ahankaaram balam darpam kaamam krodham parigraham; Vimuchya nirmamah shaanto brahmabhooyaaya kalpate. . Having abandoned egoism, strength, arrogance, anger, desire, and covetousness, free from the notion of mine and peaceful,he is fit for becoming Brahman. Brahmabhootah prasannaatmaa na shochati na kaangkshati; Samah sarveshu bhooteshu madbhaktim labhate paraam. . Becoming Brahman, serene in the Self, he neither grieves nor desires; the same to all beings, he attains supreme devotion unto Me. Bhaktyaa maamabhijaanaati yaavaanyashchaasmi tattwatah; Tato maam tattwato jnaatwaa vishate tadanantaram. . By devotion he knows Me in truth, what and who I am; and knowing Me in truth, he forthwith enters into the Supreme. Sarvakarmaanyapi sadaa kurvaano madvyapaashrayah; Matprasaadaadavaapnoti shaashwatam padamavyayam. . Doing all actions always, taking refuge in Me, by My Grace he obtains the eternal, indestructible state or abode. Chetasaa sarvakarmaani mayi sannyasya matparah; Buddhiyogam upaashritya macchittah satatam bhava. . Mentally renouncing all actions in Me, having Me as the highest goal, resorting to the Yoga of discrimination do thou ever fix thy mind on Me. Macchittah sarvadurgaani matprasaadaat tarishyasi; Atha chet twam ahankaaraan na shroshyasi vinangkshyasi. . Fixing thy mind on Me, thou shalt by My Grace overcome all obstacles; but if from egoism thou wilt not hear Me, thou shalt perish. Yadahankaaram aashritya na yotsya iti manyase; Mithyaisha vyavasaayaste prakritistwaam niyokshyati. . If, filled with egoism, thou thinkest: I will not fight, vain is this, thy resolve; Nature will compel thee. Swabhaavajena kaunteya nibaddhah swena karmanaa; Kartum necchasi yanmohaat karishyasyavashopi tat. . O Arjuna, bound by thy own Karma action born of thy own nature, that which from delusion thou wishest not to do, even that thou shalt do helplessly! COMMENTARY: Thou wilt be forced to fight because of thy nature. It will compel thee to fight, much against thy will. Eeshwarah sarvabhootaanaam hriddesherjuna tishthati; Bhraamayan sarvabhootaani yantraaroodhaani maayayaa. . The Lord dwells in the hearts of all beings, O Arjuna, causing all beings, by His illusive power, to revolve as if mounted on a machine! Tameva sharanam gaccha sarvabhaavena bhaarata; Tatprasaadaatparaam shaantim sthaanam praapsyasi shaashwatam. . Fly unto Him for refuge with all thy being, O Arjuna! By His Grace thou shalt obtain supreme peace and the eternal abode. Iti te jnaanamaakhyaatam guhyaad guhyataram mayaa; Vimrishyaitadasheshena yathecchasi tathaa kuru. . Thus has wisdom more secret than secrecy itself been declared unto thee by Me; having reflected over it fully, then act thou as thou wishest. Sarvaguhyatamam bhooyah shrinu me paramam vachah; Ishtosi me dridhamiti tato vakshyaami te hitam. . Hear thou again My supreme word, most secret of all; because thou art dearly beloved of Me, I will tell thee what is good. Manmanaa bhava madbhakto madyaajee maam namaskuru; Maamevaishyasi satyam te pratijaane priyosi me. . Fix thy mind on Me, be devoted to Me, sacrifice to Me, bow down to Me. Thou shalt come even to Me; truly do I promise unto thee, for thou art dear to Me. Sarvadharmaan parityajya maamekam sharanam vraja; Aham twaa sarvapaapebhyo mokshayishyaami maa shuchah. . Abandoning all duties, take refuge in Me alone; I will liberate thee from all sins; grieve not. Idam te naatapaskaaya naabhaktaaya kadaachana; Na chaashushrooshave vaachyam na cha maam yobhyasooyati. . This is never to be spoken by thee to one who is devoid of austerities, to one who is not devoted, nor to one who does not render service, nor who does not desire to listen, nor to one who cavils at Me. Ya imam paramam guhyam madbhakteshvabhidhaasyati; Bhaktim mayi paraam kritwaa maamevaishyatyasamshayah. . He who with supreme devotion to Me will teach this supreme secret to My devotees, shall doubtless come to Me. Na cha tasmaanmanushyeshu kashchinme priyakrittamah; Bhavitaa na cha me tasmaadanyah priyataro bhuvi. . Nor is there any among men who does dearer service to Me, nor shall there be another on earth dearer to Me than he. COMMENTARY: He who hands down this Gita to My devotees does immense service to Me. He is extremely dear to Me. In the present generation, there will be none dearer to Me in the world, nor shall there be in the future also. Adhyeshyate cha ya imam dharmyam samvaadamaavayoh; Jnaanayajnena tenaaham ishtah syaamiti me matih. . And he who will study this sacred dialogue of ours, by him I shall have been worshipped by the sacrifice of wisdom; such is My conviction. Shraddhaavaan anasooyashcha shrinuyaadapi yo narah; Sopi muktah shubhaamllokaan praapnuyaat punyakarmanaam. . The man also who hears this, full of faith and free from malice, he, too, liberated, shall attain to the happy worlds of those of righteous deeds. Kacchid etacchrutam paartha twayaikaagrena chetasaa; Kacchid ajnaanasammohah pranashtaste dhananjaya. . Has this been heard, O Arjuna, with one-pointed mind? Has the delusion of thy ignorance been fully destroyed, O Dhananjaya? Arjuna Uvaacha: Nashto mohah smritirlabdhaa twatprasaadaanmayaachyuta; Sthitosmi gata sandehah karishye vachanam tava. Arjuna said: . Destroyed is my delusion as I have gained my memory knowledge through Thy Grace, O Krishna! I am firm; my doubts are gone. I will act according to Thy word. Sanjaya Uvaacha: Ityaham vaasudevasya paarthasya cha mahaatmanah; Samvaadam imam ashrausham adbhutam romaharshanam. Sanjaya said: . Thus have I heard this wonderful dialogue between Krishna and the high-souled Arjuna, which causes the hair to stand on end. Vyaasaprasaadaacchrutavaan etadguhyamaham param; Yogam yogeshwaraat krishnaat saakshaat kathayatah swayam. . Through the Grace of Vyasa I have heard this supreme and most secret Yoga direct from Krishna, the Lord of Yoga Himself declaring it. Raajan samsmritya samsmritya samvaadam imam adbhutam; Keshavaarjunayoh punyam hrishyaami cha muhurmuhuh. . O King, remembering this wonderful and holy dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna, I rejoice again and again! Taccha samsmritya samsmritya roopamatyadbhutam hareh; Vismayo me mahaan raajan hrishyaami cha punah punah. . And remembering again and again also that most wonderful form of Hari, great is my wonder, O King! And I rejoice again and again! Yatra yogeshwarah krishno yatra paartho dhanurdharah; Tatra shreervijayo bhootirdhruvaa neetirmatirmama. . Wherever there is Krishna, the Lord of Yoga, wherever there is Arjuna, the archer, there are prosperity, happiness, victory and firm policy; such is my conviction. Hari Om Tat Sat Iti Srimad Bhagavadgeetaasoopanishatsu Brahmavidyaayaam Yogashaastre Sri Krishnaarjunasamvaade Mokshasannyaasayogo Naama Ashtaadashodhyaayah Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita, the science of the Eternal, the scripture of Yoga, the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna, ends the eighteenth discourse entitled: The Yoga of Liberation by Renunciation Om Shanti! Shanti! Shanti!

QURAN:


They took their oaths as a screen, and prevented others from Allahs path. They will have a shameful punishment. . Neither their possessions nor their children will avail them anything against Allah. These are the inhabitants of the Fire, dwelling therein forever. . On the Day when Allah will resurrect them altogetherthey will swear to Him, as they swear to you, thinking that they are upon something. Indeed, they themselves are the liars. . Satan has taken hold of them, and so has caused them to forget the remembrance of Allah. These are the partisans of Satan. Indeed, it is Satans partisans who are the losers. . Those who oppose Allah and His Messenger are among the lowliest. . Allah has written: I will certainly prevail, I and My messengers. Allah is Strong and Mighty. . You will not find a people who believe in Allah and the Last Day, loving those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, even if they were their parents, or their children, or their siblings, or their close relatives. TheseHe . THE MOBILIZATION al-Hashr has inscribed faith in their hearts, and has supported them with a spirit from Him. And He will admit them into Gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will dwell forever. Allah is pleased with them, and they are pleased with Him. These are the partisans of Allah. Indeed, it is Allahs partisans who are the successful. . THE MOBILIZATION al-Hashr In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . Glorifying Allah is all that exists in the heavens and the earth. He is the Almighty, the Most Wise. . It is He who evicted those who disbelieved among the People of the Book from their homes at the first mobilization. You did not think they would leave, and they thought their fortresses would protect them from Allah. But Allah came at them from where they never expected, and threw terror into their hearts. They wrecked their homes with their own hands, and by the hands of the believers. Therefore, take a lesson, O you who have insight. . Had Allah not decreed exile for them, He would have punished them in this life. But in the Hereafter they will have the punishment of the Fire. . That is because they opposed Allah and His Messenger. Whoever opposes AllahAllah is stern in retribution. . Whether you cut down a tree, or leave it standing on its trunk, it is by Allahs will. He will surely disgrace the sinners. . Whatever Allah has bestowed upon His Messenger from them; you spurred neither horse nor camel for them, but Allah gives authority to His messengers over whomever He will. Allah is Able to do all things. . Whatever Allah restored to His Messenger from the inhabitants of the villages belongs to Allah, and to the Messenger, and to the relatives, and to the orphans, and to the poor, and to the wayfarer; so that it may not circulate solely between the wealthy among you. Whatever the Messenger gives you, accept it; and whatever he forbids you, abstain from it. And fear Allah. Allah is severe in punishment. . To the poor refugees who were driven out of their homes and their possessions, as they sought the favor of Allah and His approval, and came to the aid of Allah and His Messenger. These are the sincere. . And those who, before them, had settled in the homeland, and had accepted faith. They love those who emigrated to them, and find no hesitation in their hearts in helping them. They give them priority over themselves, even if they themselves are needy. Whoever is protected from his natural greedit is they who are the successful. . And those who came after them, saying, Our Lord, forgive us, and our brethren who preceded us in faith, and leave no malice in our hearts towards those who believe. Our Lord, You are Clement and Merciful. . Have you not considered those who act hypocritically? They say to their brethren who disbelieved among the People of the Book, If you are evicted, we will leave with you, and will not obey anyone against you; and should anyone fight you, we will certainly support you. But Allah bears witness that they are liars. . If they are evicted, they will not leave with them; and if anyone fights them, they will not support them; and if they go to their aid, they will turn their backs and flee; then they will receive no support. . Fear of you is more intense in their hearts than fear of Allah. That is because they are a people who do not understand. . They will not fight you all together except from fortified strongholds, or from behind walls. Their hostility towards each other is severe. You would think they are united, but . THE WOMAN TESTED al-Mumtahina their hearts are diverse. That is because they are a people who do not understand. . Like those shortly before them. They experienced the consequences of their decisions. For them is a painful punishment. . Like the devil, when he says to the human being, Disbelieve. But when he has disbelieved, he says, I am innocent of you; I fear Allah, the Lord of the Worlds. . The ultimate end for both of them is the Fire, where they will dwell forever. Such is the requital for the wrongdoers. . O you who believe! Fear Allah, and let every soul consider what it has forwarded for the morrow, and fear Allah. Allah is Aware of what you do. . And do not be like those who forgot Allah, so He made them forget themselves. These are the sinners. . Not equal are the inhabitants of the Fire and the inhabitants of Paradise. It is the inhabitants of Paradise who are the winners. . Had We sent this Quran down on a mountain, you would have seen it trembling, crumbling in awe of Allah. These parables We cite for the people, so that they may reflect. . He is Allah. There is no god but He, the Knower of secrets and declarations. He is the Compassionate, the Merciful. . He is Allah; besides Whom there is no god; the Sovereign, the Holy, the Peace-Giver, the Faith-Giver, the Overseer, the Almighty, the Omnipotent, the Overwhelming. Glory be to Allah, beyond what they associate. . He is Allah; the Creator, the Maker, the Designer. His are the Most Beautiful Names. Whatever is in the heavens and the earth glorifies Him. He is the Majestic, the Wise. . THE WOMAN TESTED al-Mumtahina In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . O you who believe! Do not take My enemies and your enemies for supporters, offering them affection, when they have disbelieved in what has come to you of the Truth. They have expelled the Messenger, and you, because you believed in Allah, your Lord. If you have mobilized to strive for My cause, seeking My approval, how can you secretly love them? I know what you conceal and what you reveal. Whoever among you does that has strayed from the right way. . Whenever they encounter you, they treat you as enemies, and they stretch their hands and tongues against you with malice. They wish that you would disbelieve. . Neither your relatives nor your children will benefit you on the Day of Resurrection. He will separate between you. Allah is Observant of what you do. . You have had an excellent example in Abraham and those with him; when they said to their people, We are quit of you, and what you worship apart from Allah. We denounce you. Enmity and hatred has surfaced between us and you, forever, until you believe in Allah alone. Except for the words of Abraham to his father, I will ask forgiveness for you, though I have no power from Allah to do anything for you. Our Lord, in You we trust, and to You we repent, and to You is the ultimate resort. . Our Lord, do not make us a target for those who disbelieve, and forgive us, our Lord. You are indeed the Mighty and Wise. . There is an excellent example in them for youfor anyone who seeks Allah and the Last Day. But whoever turns awayAllah is the Self-Sufficient, the Most Praised. . Perhaps Allah will plant affection between you and those of them you consider enemies. Allah is Capable. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. . As for those who have not fought against you for your religion, nor expelled you from your homes, Allah does not prohibit you from dealing with them kindly and equitably. Allah loves the equitable. . COLUMN as-Saff . But Allah prohibits you from befriending those who fought against you over your religion, and expelled you from your homes, and aided in your expulsion. Whoever takes them for friendsthese are the wrongdoers. . O you who believe! When believing women come to you emigrating, test them. Allah is Aware of their faith. And if you find them to be faithful, do not send them back to the unbelievers. They are not lawful for them, nor are they lawful for them. But give them what they have spent. You are not at fault if you marry them, provided you give them their compensation. And do not hold on to ties with unbelieving women, but demand what you have spent, and let them demand what they have spent. This is the rule of Allah; He rules among you. Allah is Knowing and Wise. . If any of your wives desert you to the unbelievers, and you decide to penalize them, give those whose wives have gone away the equivalent of what they had spent. And fear Allah, in whom you are believers. . O prophet! If believing women come to you, pledging allegiance to you, on condition that they will not associate anything with Allah, nor steal, nor commit adultery, nor kill their children, nor commit perjury as to parenthood, nor disobey you in anything righteous, accept their allegiance and ask Allahs forgiveness for them. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. . O you who believe! Do not befriend people with whom Allah has become angry, and have despaired of the Hereafter, as the faithless have despaired of the occupants of the graves. . COLUMN as-Saff In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . Everything in the heavens and the earth praises Allah. He is the Almighty, the Wise. . O you who believe! Why do you say what you do not do? . It is most hateful to Allah that you say what you do not do. . Allah loves those who fight in His cause, in ranks, as though they were a compact structure. . When Moses said to his people, O my people, why do you hurt me, although you know that I am Allahs Messenger to you? And when they swerved, Allah swerved their hearts. Allah does not guide the sinful people. . And when Jesus son of Mary said, O Children of Israel, I am Allahs Messenger to you, confirming what preceded me of the Torah, and announcing good news of a messenger who will come after me, whose name is Ahmad. But when he showed them the miracles, they said, This is obvious sorcery. . And who is a greater wrongdoer than he who attributes falsehoods to Allah, when he is being invited to Islam? Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people. . They want to extinguish Allahs Light with their mouths; but Allah will complete His Light, even though the disbelievers dislike it. . It is He who sent His Messenger with the guidance and the true religion, to make it prevail over all religions, even though the idolaters dislike it. . O you who believe! Shall I inform you of a trade that will save you from a painful torment? . That you believe in Allah and His Messenger, and strive in the cause of Allah with your possessions and yourselves. That is best for you, if you only knew. . He will forgive you your sins; and will admit you into gardens beneath which rivers flow, and into beautiful mansions in the Gardens of Eden. That is the supreme success. . And something else you love: support from Allah, and imminent victory. So give good news to the believers. . FRIDAY al-Jumuah . O you who believe! Be supporters of Allah, as Jesus son of Mary said to the disciples, Who are my supporters towards Allah? The disciples said, We are Allahs supporters. So a group of the Children of Israel believed, while another group disbelieved. We supported those who believed against their foe, so they became dominant. . FRIDAY al-Jumuah In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . Everything in the heavens and the earth glorifies Allah the Sovereign, the Holy, the Almighty, the Wise. . It is He who sent among the unlettered a messenger from themselves; reciting His revelations to them, and purifying them, and teaching them the Scripture and wisdom; although they were in obvious error before that. . And others from them, who have not yet joined them. He is the Glorious, the Wise. . That is Allahs grace, which He grants to whomever He wills. Allah is Possessor of limitless grace. . The example of those who were entrusted with the Torah, but then failed to uphold it, is like the donkey carrying works of literature. Miserable is the example of the people who denounce Allahs revelations. Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people. . Say, O you who follow Judaism; if you claim to be the chosen of Allah, to the exclusion of the rest of mankind, then wish for death if you are sincere. . But they will not wish for it, ever, due to what their hands have advanced. Allah knows well the wrongdoers. . Say, The death from which you flee will catch up with you; then you will be returned to the Knower of the Invisible and the Visible, and He will inform you of what you used to do. . O you who believe! When the call is made for prayer on Congregation Day, hasten to the remembrance of Allah, and drop all business. That is better for you, if you only knew. . Then, when the prayer is concluded, disperse through the land, and seek Allahs bounty, and remember Allah much, so that you may prosper. . Yet whenever they come across some business, or some entertainment, they scramble towards it, and leave you standing. Say, What is with Allah is better than entertainment and business; and Allah is the Best of providers. . THE HYPOCRITES al-Munafiqun In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . When the hypocrites come to you, they say, We bear witness that you are Allahs Messenger. Allah knows that you are His Messenger, and Allah bears witness that the hypocrites are liars. . They treat their oaths as a cover, and so they repel others from Allahs path. Evil is what they do. . That is because they believed, and then disbelieved; so their hearts were sealed, and they cannot understand. . When you see them, their appearance impresses you. And when they speak, you listen to what they say. They are like propped-up timber. They think every shout is aimed at them. They are the enemy, so beware of them. Allah condemns them; how deluded they are! . And when it is said to them, Come, the Messenger of Allah will ask forgiveness for you, they bend their heads, and you see them turning away arrogantly. . It is the same for them, whether you ask forgiveness for them, or do not ask forgiveness for them; Allah will not forgive them. Allah does not guide the sinful people. . GATHERING at-Taghabun . It is they who say: Do not spend anything on those who side with Allahs Messenger, unless they have dispersed. To Allah belong the treasures of the heavens and the earth, but the hypocrites do not understand. . They say, If we return to the City, the more powerful therein will evict the weak. But power belongs to Allah, and His Messenger, and the believers; but the hypocrites do not know. . O you who believe! Let neither your possessions nor your children distract you from the remembrance of Allah. Whoever does that these are the losers. . And give from what We have provided for you, before death approaches one of you, and he says, My Lord, if only You would delay me for a short while, so that I may be charitable, and be one of the righteous. . But Allah will not delay a soul when its time has come. Allah is Informed of what you do. . GATHERING at-Taghabun In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . Everything in the heavens and the earth praises Allah. To Him belongs the Kingdom, and to Him all praise is due, and He is Able to do all things. . It is He who created you. Some of you are unbelievers, and some of you are believers. And Allah perceives what you do. . He created the heavens and the earth with truth, and He designed you, and designed you well, and to Him is the final return. . He knows everything in the heavens and the earth, and He knows what you conceal and what you reveal. And Allah knows what is within the hearts. . Has the news not reached you, of those who disbelieved before? They tasted the ill consequences of their conduct, and a painful torment awaits them. . That is because their messengers came to them with clear explanations, but they said, Are human beings going to guide us? So they disbelieved and turned away. But Allah is in no need. Allah is Independent and Praiseworthy. . Those who disbelieve claim that they will not be resurrected. Say, Yes indeed, by my Lord, you will be resurrected; then you will be informed of everything you did; and that is easy for Allah. . So believe in Allah and His Messenger, and the Light which We sent down. Allah is Aware of everything you do. . The Day when He gathers you for the Day of Gatheringthat is the Day of Mutual Exchange. Whoever believes in Allah and acts with integrity, He will remit his misdeeds, and will admit him into gardens beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein forever. That is the supreme achievement. . But as for those who disbelieve and denounce Our revelationsthese are the inmates of the Fire, dwelling therein forever; and what a miserable fate! . No disaster occurs except by Allahs leave. Whoever believes in Allah, He guides his heart. Allah is Aware of everything. . So obey Allah, and obey the Messenger. But if you turn awayit is only incumbent on Our Messenger to deliver the clear message. . Allah, there is no god but He; and in Allah let the believers put their trust. . O you who believe! Among your wives and your children are enemies to you, so beware of them. But if you pardon, and overlook, and forgiveAllah is Forgiver and Merciful. . Your possessions and your children are a test, but with Allah is a splendid reward. . So be conscious of Allah as much as you can, and listen, and obey, and give for your own good. He who is protected from his stinginessthese are the prosperous. . DIVORCE at-Talaq . If you lend Allah a good loan, He will multiply it for you, and will forgive you. Allah is Appreciative and Forbearing. . The Knower of the Unseen and the Seen, the Almighty, the Wise. . DIVORCE at-Talaq In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . O Prophet! If any of you divorce women, divorce them during their period of purity, and calculate their term. And be pious before Allah, your Lord. And do not evict them from their homes, nor shall they leave, unless they have committed a proven adultery. These are the limits of Allahwhoever oversteps Allahs limits has wronged his own soul. You never know; Allah may afterwards bring about a new situation. . Once they have reached their term, either retain them honorably, or separate from them honorably. And call to witness two just people from among you, and give upright testimony for Allah. By that is exhorted whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day. And whoever fears AllahHe will make a way out for him. . And will provide for him from where he never expected. Whoever relies on Allah He will suffice him. Allah will accomplish His purpose. Allah has set a measure to all things. . As for those of your women who have reached menopause, if you have any doubts, their term shall be three monthsand also for those who have not menstruated. As for those who are pregnant, their term shall be until they have delivered. Whoever fears AllahHe will make things easy for him. . This is the ordinance of Allah, which He sent down to you. Whoever fears AllahHe will remit his sins, and will amplify his reward. . Allow them to reside where you reside, according to your means, and do not harass them in order to make things difficult for them. If they are pregnant, spend on them until they give birth. And if they nurse your infant, give them their payment. And conduct your relation in amity. But if you disagree, then let another woman nurse him. . The wealthy shall spend according to his means; and he whose resources are restricted shall spend according to what Allah has given him. Allah never burdens a soul beyond what He has given it. Allah will bring ease after hardship. . How many a town defied the command of its Lord and His messengers? So We held it strictly accountable, and We punished it with a dreadful punishment. . It tasted the result of its decisions, and the outcome of its decisions was perdition. . Allah has prepared for them a severe retribution. So beware of Allah, O you who possess intellect and have faith. Allah has sent down to you a Reminder. . A messenger who recites to you Allahs Verses, clear and distinct, that he may bring those who believe and work righteousness from darkness into light. Whoever believes in Allah and acts with integrity, He will admit him into gardens beneath which rivers flow, therein to abide forever. Allah has given him an excellent provision. . Allah is He Who created seven heavens, and their like of earth. The command descends through them, so that you may know that Allah is Capable of everything, and that Allah Encompasses everything in knowledge. . PROHIBITION at-Tahrim In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . O prophet! Why do you prohibit what Allah has permitted for you, seeking to please your wives? Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. . SOVEREIGNTY al-Mulk . Allah has decreed for you the dissolution of your oaths. Allah is your Master. He is the All-Knowing, the Most Wise. . The Prophet told something in confidence to one of his wives. But when she disclosed it, and Allah made it known to him; he communicated part of it, and he avoided another part. Then, when he informed her of it, she said, Who informed you of this? He said, The All-Knowing, the All-Informed, informed me. . If you repent to Allah, then your hearts have listened. But if you band together against him, then Allah is his Ally, as is Gabriel, and the righteous believers. In addition, the angels will assist him. . Perhaps, if he divorces you, his Lord will give him in exchange wives better than you: submissive, believing, obedient, penitent, devout, fastingpreviously married, or virgins. . O you who believe! Protect yourselves and your families from a Fire, whose fuel is people and stones. Over it are angels, fierce and powerful. They never disobey Allah in anything He commands them, and they carry out whatever they are commanded. . O you who disbelieved! Make no excuses today. You are being repaid for what you used to do. . O you who believe! Repent to Allah with sincere repentance. Perhaps your Lord will remit your sins, and admit you into gardens beneath which rivers flow, on the Day when Allah will not disappoint the Prophet and those who believed with him. Their light streaming before them, and to their right, they will say, Our Lord, complete our light for us, and forgive us; You are capable of all things. . O prophet! Strive hard against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be stern with them. Their abode is Hell. What a miserable destination! . Allah illustrates an example of those who disbelieve: the wife of Noah and the wife of Lot. They were under two of Our righteous servants, but they betrayed them. They availed them nothing against Allah, and it was said, Enter the Fire with those who are entering. . And Allah illustrates an example of those who believe: the wife of Pharaoh, when she said, My Lord, build for me, with you, a house in Paradise, and save me from Pharaoh and his works, and save me from the wrongdoing people. . And Mary, the daughter of Imran, who guarded her womb, and so We breathed into her of Our Spirit; and she believed in the truth of her Lords Words and His Books, and was one of the devout. . SOVEREIGNTY al-Mulk In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . Blessed is He in whose hand is the sovereignty, and Who has power over everything. . He who created death and lifeto test youas to which of you is better in conduct. He is the Almighty, the Forgiving. . He who created seven heavens in layers. You see no discrepancy in the creation of the Compassionate. Look again. Can you see any cracks? . Then look again, and again, and your sight will return to you dazzled and exhausted. . We have adorned the lower heaven with lanterns, and made them missiles against the devils; and We have prepared for them the punishment of the Blaze. . For those who reject their Lord, there is the torment of Hell. What an evil destination! . When they are thrown into it, they will hear it roaring, as it seethes. . It almost bursts with fury. Every time a batch is thrown into it, its keepers will ask them, Has no warner come to you? . THE PEN al-Qalam . They will say, Yes, a warner did come to us, but we disbelieved, and said, Allah did not send down anything; you are very much mistaken. . And they will say, Had we listened or reasoned, we would not have been among the inmates of the Blaze. . So they will acknowledge their sins. So away with the inmates of the Blaze. . As for those who fear their Lord in secret for them is forgiveness and a great reward. . Whether you keep your words secret, or declare themHe is Aware of the inner thoughts. . Would He not know, He Who created? He is the Refined, the Expert. . It is He who made the earth manageable for you, so travel its regions, and eat of His provisions. To Him is the Resurgence. . Are you confident that the One in heaven will not cause the earth to collapse beneath you as it spins? . Or are you confident that the One in Heaven will not unleash against you a violent storm? Then you will know what My warning is like. . Those before them also denied the truth; and how was My disapproval? . Have they not seen the birds above them, spreading their wings, and folding them? None holds them except the Compassionate. He is Perceiver of everything. . Or who is this who is a force for you to protect you against the Compassionate? The disbelievers are in nothing but delusion. . Or who is this that will provide for you, if He withholds His provision? Yet they persist in defiance and aversion. . Is he who walks bent on his own design better guided, or he who walks upright on a straight path? . Say, It is He who produced you; and made for you the hearing, and the vision, and the organs. But rarely do you give thanks. . Say, It is He who scattered you on earth, and to Him you will be rounded up. . And they say, When will this promise be fulfilled, if you are truthful? . Say, Knowledge is with Allah, and I am only a clear warner. . But when they see it approaching, the faces of those who disbelieved will turn gloomy, and it will be said, This is what you used to call for. . Say, Have you considered? Should Allah make me perish, and those with me; or else He bestows His mercy on us; who will protect the disbelievers from an agonizing torment? . Say, He is the Compassionate. We have faith in Him, and in Him we trust. Soon you will know who is in evident error. . Say, Have you considered? If your water drains away, who will bring you pure running water? . THE PEN al-Qalam In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . Noon. By the pen, and by what they inscribe. . By the grace of your Lord, you are not insane. . In fact, you will have a reward that will never end. . And you are of a great moral character. . You will see, and they will see. . Which of you is the afflicted. . Your Lord knows best who has strayed from His path, and He knows best the well-guided. . So do not obey the deniers. . They would like you to compromise, so they would compromise. . And do not obey any vile swearer. . Backbiter, spreader of slander. . THE PEN al-Qalam . Preventer of good, transgressor, sinner. . Rude and fake besides. . Just because he has money and children. . When Our Verses are recited to him, he says, Myths of the ancients! . We will brand him on the muzzle. . We tested them, as We tested the owners of the garden, when they vowed to harvest it in the morning. . Without any reservation. . But a calamity from your Lord went around it while they slept. . And in the morning it was as if picked. . In the morning, they called to one another. . Go early to your plantation, if you are going to harvest. . So off they went, murmuring to one another. . No poor person is to enter it upon you today. . And early they went, resolved in intent. . But when they saw it, they said, We were wrong. . We are now deprived. . The most reasonable of them said, Did I not say to you, if only you would glorify? . They said, Glory to our LordWe were indeed in the wrong. . Then they turned to one another, blaming one another. . They said, Woe to uswe were indeed domineering. . Perhaps our Lord will give us a better substitute for it. We are turning to our Lord. . Such is the punishment; but the punishment of the Hereafter is greater, if they only knew. . For the righteous are Gardens of Delight with their Lord. . Shall We treat the Muslims like the villains? . What is the matter with you? How do you judge? . Or do you have a scripture in which you study. . Wherein there is whatever you choose? . Or do you have oaths from Us, binding until the Day of Resurrection, that you will have whatever you demand? . Ask them, which of them will guarantee that. . Or do they have partners? Then let them produce their partners, if they are truthful. . On the Day when the Shin will be exposed, and they will be called to bow down, but they will be unable. . Their eyes subdued, shame will cover them. They were invited to bow down when they were sound. . So leave Me to those who reject this discourse; We will proceed against them gradually, from where they do not know. . And I will give them respite. My plan is firm. . Or do you ask them for a fee, so they are burdened with debt? . Or do they know the future, and so they write it down? . So wait patiently for the Decision of your Lord, and do not be like the Fellow of the Fish who cried out in despair. . Were it not for his Lords favor that reached him, he would have been thrown into the wilderness, fully despised. . But his Lord chose him, and made him one of the righteous. . Those who disbelieve almost stab you with their glances when they hear the message, and say, He is crazy! . But it is no less than a reminder to all the Worlds. . THE REALITY al-Haqqah . THE REALITY al-Haqqah In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . The Reality. . What is the Reality? . What will make you understand what the Reality is? . Thamood and Aad denied the Catastrophe. . As for Thamood, they were annihilated by the Overwhelming. . And as for Aad; they were annihilated by a furious, roaring wind. . He unleashed it upon them for seven nights and eight days, in succession. You could see the people tossed around, as though they were stumps of hollow palm-trees. . Can you see any remnant of them? . Then Pharaoh came, and those before him, and the Overturned Cities steeped in sin. . But they disobeyed the messenger of their Lord, so He seized them with an overpowering grip. . When the waters overflowed, We carried you in the cruising ship. . To make it a lesson for youso that retaining ears may retain it. . Then, when the Trumpet is sounded a single time. . And the earth and the mountains are lifted up, and crushed, with a single crush. . On that Day, the Event will come to pass. . And the heaven will crack; so on that Day it will be frail. . And the angels will be ranged around its borders, while eight will be carrying the Throne of your Lord above them that Day. . On that Day you will be exposed, and no secret of yours will remain hidden. . As for him who is given his book in his right hand, he will say, Here, take my book and read it. . I knew I would be held accountable. . So he will be in pleasant living. . In a lofty Garden. . Its pickings are within reach. . Eat and drink merrily for what you did in the days gone by. . But as for him who is given his book in his left hand, he will say, I wish I was never given my book. . And never knew what my account was. . If only it was the end. . My money cannot avail me. . My power has vanished from me. . Take him and shackle him. . Then scorch him in the Blaze. . Then in a chain which length is seventy cubits tie him up. . For he would not believe in Allah the Great. . Nor would he advocate the feeding of the destitute. . So he has no friend here today. . And no food except scum. . Which only the sinners eat. . Indeed, I swear by what you see. . And by what you do not see. . It is the speech of a noble messenger. . And it is not the speech of a poetlittle do you believe. . Nor is it the speech of a soothsayerlittle do you take heed. . It is a revelation from the Lord of the Worlds. . Had he falsely attributed some statements to Us. . We would have seized him by the right arm. . WAYS OF ASCENT al-Maarij . Then slashed his lifeline. . And none of you could have restrained Us from him. . Surely, it is a message for the righteous. . And We know that some of you will reject it. . And it is surely a source of grief for the unbelievers. . Yet it is the absolute truth. . So glorify the name of your Lord, the Magnificent. . WAYS OF ASCENT al-Maarij In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . A questioner questioned the imminent torment. . For the disbelievers; none can repel it. . From Allah, Lord of the Ways of Ascent. . Unto Him the angels and the Spirit ascend on a Day the duration of which is fifty thousand years. . So be patient, with sweet patience. . They see it distant. . But We see it near. . On the Day when the sky will be like molten brass. . And the mountains will be like tufted wool. . No friend will care about his friend. . They will be shown each other. The criminal wishes he would be redeemed from the punishment of that Day by his children. . And his spouse, and his brother. . And his family that sheltered him. . And everyone on earth, in order to save him. . By no means! It is a Raging Fire. . It strips away the scalps. . It invites him who once turned his back and fled. . And accumulated and hoarded. . Man was created restless. . Touched by adversity, he is fretful. . Touched by good, he is ungenerous. . Except the prayerful. . Those who are constant at their prayers. . And those in whose wealth is a rightful share. . For the beggar and the deprived. . And those who affirm the Day of Judgment. . And those who fear the punishment of their Lord. . Their Lords punishment is not to be taken for granted. . And those who guard their chastity. . Except from their spouses or those living under their control, for then they are free of blame. . But whoever seeks to go beyond that these are the transgressors. . And those who honor their trusts and their pledges. . And those who stand by their testimonies. . And those who are dedicated to their prayers. . These will be honored in Gardens. . What is with those who disbelieve, stretching their necks towards you. . From the right, and from the left, banding together? . Is every one of them aspiring to be admitted into a Garden of Bliss? . No indeed! We created them from what they know. . I swear by the Lord of the Easts and the Wests, that We are Able. . NOAH Nuh . To replace them with better than they, and We are not to be outdone. . So leave them to blunder and play, until they meet their Day which they are promised. . The Day when they will emerge from the tombs in a rush, as though they were hurrying towards a target. . Their eyes cast down; overwhelmed by humiliation. This is the Day which they were promised. . NOAH Nuh In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . We sent Noah to his people: Warn your people before there comes upon them a painful punishment. . He said, O my people, I am to you a clear warner. . Worship Allah and reverence Him, and obey me. . And He will forgive you of your sins, and reprieve you until a stated term. Allahs term cannot be deferred once it has arrived, if you only knew. . He said, My Lord, I have called my people night and day. . But my call added only to their flight. . Whenever I called them to Your forgiveness, they thrust their fingers into their ears, and wrapped themselves in their garments, and insisted, and became more and more arrogant. . Then I called them openly. . Then I appealed to them publicly, and I spoke to them privately. . I said, Ask your Lord for forgiveness; He is Forgiving. . He will let loose the sky upon you in torrents. . And provide you with wealth and children, and allot for you gardens, and allot for you rivers. . What is the matter with you, that you do not appreciate Allahs Greatness? . Although He created you in stages. . Do you not realize that Allah created seven heavens in layers? . And He set the moon in their midst for light, and He made the sun a lamp. . And Allah germinated you from the earth like plants. . Then He will return you into it, and will bring you out again. . And Allah made the earth a spread for you. . That you may travel its diverse roads. . Noah said, My Lord, they have defied me, and followed him whose wealth and children increase him only in perdition. . And they schemed outrageous schemes. . And they said, Do not give up your gods; do not give up Wadd, nor Souwa, nor Yaghoos, and Yaooq, and Nassr. . They have misled many, so do not increase the wrongdoers except in confusion. . Because of their wrongs, they were drowned, and were hurled into a Fire. They did not find apart from Allah any helpers. . Noah said, My Lord, do not leave of the unbelievers a single dweller on earth. . If You leave them, they will mislead your servants, and will breed only wicked unbelievers. . My Lord! Forgive me and my parents, and anyone who enters my home in faith, and all the believing men and believing women; and do not increase the wrongdoers except in perdition. . THE JINN al-Jinn In the name of Allah, . THE ENWRAPPED al-Muzzammil the Gracious, the Merciful . Say, It was revealed to me that a band of jinn listened in, and said, We have heard a wondrous Quran. . It guides to rectitude, so we have believed in it; and we will never associate anyone with our Lord. . And Exalted is the Grandeur of our Lord He never had a mate, nor a child. . But the fools among us used to say nonsense about Allah. . And we thought that humans and jinn would never utter lies about Allah. . Some individual humans used to seek power through some individual jinn, but they only increased them in confusion. . They thought, as you thought, that Allah would never resurrect anyone. . We probed the heaven, and found it filled with stern guards and projectiles. . We used to take up positions to listen in; but whoever listens now finds a projectile in wait for him. . We do not know whether ill is intended for those on earth, or if their Lord intends goodness for them. . Some of us are righteous, but some of us are less than that; we follow divergent paths. . We realized that we cannot defeat Allah on earth, and that we cannot escape Him by fleeing. . And when we heard the guidance, we believed in it. Whoever believes in his Lord fears neither loss, nor burden. . Among us are those who are submitting, and among us are the compromisers. As for those who have submittedit is they who pursue rectitude. . But as for the compromisersthey will be firewood for Hell. . Had they kept true to the Path, We would have given them plenty water to drink. . To test them with it. Whoever turns away from the remembrance of his Lord, He will direct him to torment ever mounting. . The places of worship are for Allah. So do not call, besides Allah, upon anyone else. . And when the servant of Allah got up calling on Him, they almost fell on him in a mass. . Say, I pray only to my Lord, and I never associate anyone with Him. . Say, It is not in my power to harm you, nor to bring you to right conduct. . Say, No one can protect me from Allah, and I will not find any refuge except with Him. . Except for a proclamation from Allah and His messages. He who defies Allah and His Messengerfor him is the Fire of Hell, in which they will dwell forever. . Until, when they see what they were promised, they will know who is weaker in helpers, and fewer in numbers. . Say, I do not know whether what you are promised is near, or whether my Lord will extend it for a period. . The Knower of the Invisible; He does not disclose His Invisible to anyone. . Except to a Messenger of His choosing. He then dispatches guards before him and behind him. . That He may know that they have conveyed the messages of their Lord. He encompasses what they have, and has tallied everything by number. . THE ENWRAPPED al-Muzzammil In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . O you Enwrapped one. . Stay up during the night, except a little. . For half of it, or reduce it a little. . THE ENROBED al-Muddathir . Or add to it; and chant the Quran rhythmically. . We are about to give you a heavy message. . The vigil of night is more effective, and better suited for recitation. . In the daytime, you have lengthy work to do. . So remember the Name of your Lord, and devote yourself to Him wholeheartedly. . Lord of the East and the West. There is no god but He, so take Him as a Trustee. . And endure patiently what they say, and withdraw from them politely. . And leave Me to those who deny the truth, those of luxury, and give them a brief respite. . With Us are shackles, and a Fierce Fire. . And food that chokes, and a painful punishment. . On the Day when the earth and the mountains tremble, and the mountains become heaps of sand. . We have sent to you a messenger, a witness over you, as We sent to Pharaoh a messenger. . But Pharaoh defied the Messenger, so We seized him with a terrible seizing. . So how will you, if you persist in unbelief, save yourself from a Day which will turn the children gray-haired? . The heaven will shatter thereby. His promise is always fulfilled. . This is a reminder. So whoever wills, let him take a path to his Lord. . Your Lord knows that you stay up nearly two-thirds of the night, or half of it, or onethird of it, along with a group of those with you. Allah designed the night and the day. He knows that you are unable to sustain it, so He has pardoned you. So read of the Quran what is possible for you. He knows that some of you may be ill; and others travelling through the land, seeking Allahs bounty; and others fighting in Allahs cause. So read of it what is possible for you, and observe the prayers, and give regular charity, and lend Allah a generous loan. Whatever good you advance for yourselves, you will find it with Allah, better and generously rewarded. And seek Allahs forgiveness, for Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. . THE ENROBED al-Muddathir In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . O you Enrobed one. . Arise and warn. . And magnify your Lord. . And purify your clothes. .And abandon abominations. . And show no favor seeking gain. . And be constant for your Lord. . When the Trumpet is blown. . That Day will be a difficult day. . For the disbelieversnot easy. . Leave Me to him whom I created alone. . And gave him vast wealth. . And children as witnesses. . And smoothed things for him. . Then he wants Me to add yet more! . By no means! He was stubborn towards Our revelations. . I will exhaust him increasingly. . He thought and analyzed. . May he perish, how he analyzed. . Again: may he perish, how he analyzed. . Then he looked. . Then he frowned and whined. . Then he turned back and was proud. . And said, This is nothing but magic from the past. . This is nothing but the word of a mortal. . RESURRECTION al-Qiyamah . I will roast him in Saqar. . But what will explain to you what Saqar is? . It neither leaves, nor spares. . It scorches the flesh. . Over it are Nineteen. . We have appointed only angels to be wardens of the Fire, and caused their number to be a stumbling block for those who disbelieve; so that those given the Scripture may attain certainty; and those who believe may increase in faith; and those given the Scripture and the believers may not doubt; and those in whose hearts is sickness and the unbelievers may say, What did Allah intend by this parable? Thus Allah leads astray whom He wills, and guides whom He wills. None knows the soldiers of your Lord except He. This is nothing but a reminder for the mortals. . Nay! By the moon. . And the night as it retreats. . And the morning as it lights up. . It is one of the greatest. . A warning to the mortals. . To whomever among you wishes to advance, or regress. . Every soul is hostage to what it has earned. . Except for those on the Right. . In Gardens, inquiring. . About the guilty. . What drove you into Saqar? . They will say, We were not of those who prayed. . Nor did we feed the destitute. . And we used to indulge with those who indulge. . And we used to deny the Day of Judgment. . Until the Inevitable came upon us. . But the intercession of intercessors will not help them. . Why are they turning away from the Reminder? . As though they were panicked donkeys. . Fleeing from a lion? . Yet every one of them desires to be given scrolls unrolled. . No indeed! But they do not fear the Hereafter. . Nevertheless, it is a reminder. . So whoever wills, shall remember it. . But they will not remember, unless Allah wills. He is the Source of Righteousness, and the Source of Forgiveness. . RESURRECTION al-Qiyamah In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . I swear by the Day of Resurrection. . And I swear by the blaming soul. . Does man think that We will not reassemble his bones? . Yes indeed; We are Able to reconstruct his fingertips. . But man wants to deny what is ahead of him. . He asks, When is the Day of Resurrection? . When vision is dazzled. . And the moon is eclipsed. . And the sun and the moon are joined together. . On that Day, man will say, Where is the escape? . No indeed! There is no refuge. . To your Lord on that Day is the settlement. . On that Day man will be informed of everything he put forward, and everything he left behind. . And man will be evidence against himself. . MAN al-Insan . Even as he presents his excuses. . Do not wag your tongue with it, to hurry on with it. . Upon Us is its collection and its recitation. . Then, when We have recited it, follow its recitation. . Then upon Us is its explanation. . Alas, you love the fleeting life. . And you disregard the Hereafter. . Faces on that Day will be radiant. . Looking towards their Lord. . And faces on that Day will be gloomy. . Realizing that a back-breaker has befallen them. . Indeed, when it has reached the breastbones. . And it is said, Who is the healer? . And He realizes that it is the parting. . And leg is entwined with leg. . To your Lord on that Day is the drive. . He neither believed nor prayed. . But he denied and turned away. . Then he went to his family, full of pride. . Woe to you; and woe. . Then again: Woe to you; and woe. . Does man think that he will be left without purpose? . Was he not a drop of ejaculated semen? . Then he became a clot. And He created and proportioned? . And made of him the two sexes, the male and the female? . Is He not Able to revive the dead? . MAN al-Insan In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . Has there come upon man a period of time when he was nothing to be mentioned? . We created man from a liquid mixture, to test him; and We made him hearing and seeing. . We guided him to the way, be he appreciative or unappreciative. . We have prepared for the faithless chains, and yokes, and a Searing Fire. . But the righteous will drink from a cup whose mixture is aroma. . A spring from which the servants of Allah will drink, making it gush abundantly. . They fulfill their vows, and dread a Day whose ill is widespread. . And they feed, for the love of Him, the poor, and the orphan, and the captive. . We only feed you for the sake of Allah. We want from you neither compensation, nor gratitude. . We dread from our Lord a frowning grim Day. . So Allah will protect them from the ills of that Day, and will grant them radiance and joy. . And will reward them for their patience with a Garden and silk. . Reclining therein on the thrones; experiencing therein neither sun, nor frost. . Its shade hovering over them, and its fruit brought low within reach. . Passing around them are vessels of silver, and cups of crystal. . Crystal of silverthey measured them exactly. . They will be served therein with a cup whose flavor is Zanjabeel. . A spring therein named Salsabeel. . Passing among them are eternalized youths. If you see them, you would think them sprinkled pearls. . THE UNLEASHED al-Mursalat . Wherever you look, you see bliss, and a vast kingdom. . Upon them are garments of green silk, and satin. And they will be adorned with bracelets of silver. And their Lord will offer them a pure drink. . This is a reward for you. Your efforts are well appreciated. . It is We who sent down the Quran upon youa gradual revelation. . So be patient for the decision of your Lord, and do not obey the sinner or the blasphemer among them. . And mention the Name of your Lord, morning and evening. . And for part of the night, prostrate yourself to Him, and glorify Him long into the night. . As for these: they love the fleeting life, and leave behind a Heavy Day. . We created them, and strengthened their frame; and whenever We will, We can replace them with others like them. . This is a reminder; so whoever wills, let him take a path to his Lord. . Yet you cannot will, unless Allah wills. Allah is Knowing and Wise. . He admits into His mercy whomever He wills. But as for the wrongdoers, He has prepared for them a painful punishment. . THE UNLEASHED al-Mursalat In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . By those unleashed in succession. . Storming turbulently. . Scattering far and wide. . Separating decisively. . Delivering a message. . Excusing or warning. . Surely what you are promised will happen. . When the stars are obliterated. . And the sky is fractured. . And the mountains are blown away. . And the messengers are alerted. . Until which day is it deferred? . Until the Day of Decision. . And what will teach you what the Day of Decision is? . Woe on that Day to the liars. . Did We not destroy the ancients? . Then succeeded them with the others? . This is how We deal with the guilty. . Woe on that Day to the rejecters. . Did We not create you from an insignificant fluid? . Then lodged it in a secure place? . For a known term? . We measured precisely. We are the best to measure. . Woe on that Day to the falsifiers. . Did We not make the earth a homestead? . For the living and the dead? . And set on it lofty mountains, and given you pure water to drink? . Woe on that Day to the deniers. . Proceed to what you used to deny. . Proceed to a shadow of three different masses. . Offering no shade, and unavailing against the flames. . It shoots sparks as castles. . As if they were yellow camels. . Woe on that Day to the liars. . This is a Day when they will not speak. . And they will not be allowed to apologize. . Woe on that Day to the rejecters. . This is the Day of Separation; We have gathered you, together with the ancients. . THE EVENT an-Naba . So if you have a strategy, use it against Me. . Woe on that Day to the falsifiers. . The righteous will be amidst shades and fountains. . And fruits as they desire. . Eat and drink pleasantly, for what you used to do. . This is how We reward the doers of good. . Woe on that Day to the deniers. . Eat and enjoy yourselves a little; you are indeed criminals. . Woe on that Day to the liars. . And when it is said to them, Kneel, they do not kneel. . Woe on that Day to the rejecters. . In what message, beyond this, will they believe? . THE EVENT an-Naba In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . What are they asking one another about? . About the Great Event. . About which they disagree. . Surely, they will find out. . Most certainly, they will find out. . Did We not make the earth a cradle? . And the mountains pegs? . And created you in pairs? . And made your sleep for rest? . And made the night a cover? . And made the day for livelihood? . And built above you seven strong ones? . And placed a blazing lamp? . And brought down from the clouds pouring water? . To produce with it grains and vegetation? . And luxuriant gardens? . The Day of Sorting has been appointed. . The Day when the Trumpet is blown, and you will come in droves. . And the sky is opened up, and becomes gateways. . And the mountains are set in motion, and become a mirage. . Hell is lying in ambush. . For the oppressors, a destination. . Where they will remain for eons. . They will taste therein neither coolness, nor drink. . Except boiling water, and freezing hail. . A fitting requital. . For they were not anticipating any reckoning. . And they denied Our signs utterly. . But We have enumerated everything in writing. . So taste! We will increase you only in suffering. . But for the righteous there is triumph. . Gardens and vineyards. . And splendid spouses, well matched. . And delicious drinks. . They will hear therein neither gossip, nor lies. . A reward from your Lord, a fitting gift. . Lord of the heavens and the earth, and everything between themThe Most Mercifulnone can argue with Him. . On the Day when the Spirit and the angels stand in row. They will not speak, unless it be one permitted by the Most Merciful, and he will say what is right. . That is the Day of Reality. So whoever wills, let him take a way back to his Lord. . We have warned you of a near punishmentthe Day when a person will observe . THE SNATCHERS an-Naziat what his hands have produced, and the faithless will say, O, I wish I were dust. . THE SNATCHERS an-Naziat In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . By those who snatch violently. . And those who remove gently. . And those who glide smoothly. . And those who race swiftly. . And those who regulate events. . On the Day when the Quake quakes. . And is followed by the Successor. . Hearts on that Day will be pounding. . Their sights downcast. . They say, Are we to be restored to the original condition? . When we have become hollow bones? . They say, This is a losing proposition. . But it will be only a single nudge. . And they will be awake. . Has the story of Moses reached you? . When His Lord called out to him in the sacred valley of Tuwa. . Go to Pharaohhe has transgressed. . And say, Do you care to be cleansed? . And I will guide you to your Lord, and you will turn reverent. . He showed him the Greatest Miracle. . But he denied and defied. . Then turned his back, and tried. . And gathered and proclaimed. . He said, I am your Lord, the most high. . So Allah seized him with an exemplary punishment, in the last and in the first. . In this is a lesson for whoever fears. . Are you more difficult to create, or the heaven? He constructed it. . He raised its masses, and proportioned it. . And He dimmed its night, and brought out its daylight. . And the earth after that He spread. . And from it, He produced its water and its pasture. . And the mountains, He anchored. . A source of enjoyment for you and for your animals. . But when the Great Cataclysm arrives. . A Day when man will remember what he has endeavored. . And Hell will be displayed to whoever sees. . As for him who was defiant. . And preferred the life of this world. . Then Hell is the shelter. . But as for him who feared the Standing of his Lord, and restrained the self from desires. . Then Paradise is the shelter. . They ask you about the Hour, When will it take place? . You have no knowledge of it. . To your Lord is its finality. . You are just a warner for whoever dreads it. . On the Day when they witness itas though they only stayed an evening, or its morning. . HE FROWNED Abasa In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . He frowned and turned away. . When the blind man approached him. . But how do you know? Perhaps he was seeking to purify himself. . THE ROLLING at-Takwir . Or be reminded, and the message would benefit him. . But as for him who was indifferent. . You gave him your attention. . Though you are not liable if he does not purify himself. . But as for him who came to you seeking. . In awe. . To him you were inattentive. . Do not. This is a Lesson. . Whoever wills, shall remember it. . On honorable pages. . Exalted and purified. . By the hands of scribes. . Noble and devoted. . Perish man! How thankless he is! . From what did He create him? . From a sperm drop He created him, and enabled him. . Then He eased the way for him. . Then He puts him to death, and buries him. . Then, when He wills, He will resurrect him. . But no, he did not fulfill what He has commanded him. . Let man consider his food. . We pour down water in abundance. . Then crack the soil open. . And grow in it grains. . And grapes and herbs. . And olives and dates. . And luscious gardens. . And fruits and vegetables. . Enjoyment for you, and for your livestock. . But when the Deafening Noise comes to pass. . The Day when a person will flee from his brother. . And his mother and his father. . And his consort and his children. .

THE SHATTERING al-Infitar In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . When the sky breaks apart. . When the planets are scattered. . When the oceans are exploded. . When the tombs are strewn around. . Each soul will know what it has advanced, and what it has deferred. . O man! What deluded you concerning your Lord, the Most Generous? .

They know everything you do. . The virtuous will be in bliss. . While the wicked will be in Hell. . They will enter it on the Day of Justice. . And they will not be absent from it. . But what will convey to you what the Day of Justice is? . Then again, what will convey to you what the Day of Justice is? . The Day when no soul will avail another soul anything; and the decision on that Day is Allahs. . THE DEFRAUDERS al-Mutaffifin In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . Woe to the defrauders. . Those who, when they take a measure from people, they take in full. . But when they measure or weigh to others, they cheat. . Do these not know that they will be resurrected? . For a Great Day? . The Day when mankind will stand before the Lord of the Worlds? . Not at all. The record of the wicked is in Sijjeen. . But how can you know what Sijjeen is? . A numerical book. . Woe on that Day to the deniers. . Those who deny the Day of Reckoning. . But none denies it except the sinful aggressor. . When Our revelations are recited to him, he says, Legends of the ancients. . Not at all. Their hearts have become corroded by what they used to earn. . Not at all. On that Day, they will be screened from their Lord. . Then they will roast in Hell. . Then it will be said, This is what you used to deny. . THE RUPTURE al-Inshiqaq . No indeed; the record of the righteous is in Elliyyeen. . But how can you know what Elliyyoon is? . A numerical book. . Witnessed by those brought near. . Indeed, the righteous will be amid bliss. .

Roasting in a scorching Fire. . Given to drink from a flaming spring. . They will have no food except thorns. . That neither nourishes, nor satisfies hunger. . Faces on that Day will be joyful. . Satisfied with their endeavor. . In a lofty Garden. . In it you will hear no nonsense. . In it is a flowing spring. . In it are raised beds. . And cups set in place. . And cushions set in rows. . And carpets spread around. . Do they not look at the camelshow they are created? . And at the skyhow it is raised? . And at the mountainshow they are installed? .

Allah will punish him with the greatest punishment. . To Us is their return. . Then upon Us rests their reckoning. . THE DAWN al-Fajr In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful . By the daybreak. . And ten nights. . And the even and the odd. . And the night as it recedes. . Is there in this an oath for a rational person? . Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with Aad? . Erum of the pillars. . The like of which was never created in the land. . And Thamoodthose who carved the rocks in the valley. . And Pharaoh of the Stakes. .

As for man, whenever his Lord tests him, and honors him, and prospers him, he says, My Lord has honored me. . But whenever He tests him, and restricts his livelihood for him, he says, My Lord has insulted me. . Not at all. But you do not honor the orphan. . And you do not urge the feeding of the poor. . THE LAND al-Balad . And you devour inheritance with all greed. . And you love wealth with immense love. . Nowhen the earth is leveled, pounded, and crushed. . And your Lord comes, with the angels, row after row. . And on that Day, Hell is brought forward. On that Day, man will remember, but how will remembrance avail him? . He will say, If only I had forwarded for my life. . On that Day, none will punish as He punishes. . And none will shackle as He shackles. . But as for you, O tranquil soul. .

BIBLE:


Naaman entered to his lord, and he reported to him, saying: The girl from the land of Israel spoke in such a manner. Kings : And the king of Syria said to him, Go, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel. And when he had set out, he had taken with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand gold coins, and ten changes of fine clothing. Kings : And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, in these words: When you will receive this letter, know that I have sent to you my servant, Naaman, so that you may heal him of his leprosy. Kings : And when the king of Israel had read the letter, he tore his garments, and he said: Am I God, so that I could take or give life, or so that this man would send to me to cure a man from his leprosy? Take notice and see that he is seeking occasions against me. Kings : And when Elisha, the man of God, had heard this, specifically, that the king of Israel had torn his garments, he sent to him, saying: Why have you torn your garments? Let him come to me, and let him know that there is a prophet in Israel. Kings : Therefore, Naaman arrived with his horses and chariots, and he stood at the door of the house of Elisha. Kings : And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, Go, and wash seven times in the Jordan, and your flesh will receive health, and you will be clean. Kings : And becoming angry, Naaman went away, saying: I thought that he would have come out to me, and, standing, would have invoked the name of the Lord, his God, and that he would have touched the place of the leprosy with his hand, and so have healed me. Kings : Are not the Abana and the Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel, so that I might wash in them and be cleansed? But then, after he had turned himself away and was leaving with indignation, Kings : his servants approached him, and they said to him: If the prophet had told you, father, to do something great, certainly you ought to have done it. How much more so, now that he has said to you: Wash, and you will be clean? Kings : So he descended and washed in the Jordan seven times, in accord with the word of the man of God. And his flesh was restored, like the flesh of a little child. And he was made clean. Kings : And returning to the man of God, with his entire retinue, he arrived, and stood before him, and he said: Truly, I know there is no other God, in all the earth, except in Israel. And so I beg you to accept a blessing from your servant. Kings : But he responded, As the Lord lives, before whom I stand, I will not accept it. And though he urged him strongly, he did not agree at all. Kings : And Naaman said: As you wish. But I beg you to grant to me, your servant, that I may take from here the burden of two mules from the ground. For your servant will no longer offer holocaust or victim to other gods, except to the Lord. Kings : But there is still this matter, for which you will entreat the Lord on behalf of your servant: when my lord enters the temple of Rimmon, so that he may adore there, and he leans on my hand, if I will bow down in the temple of Rimmon, while he is adoring in the same place, that the Lord may ignore me, your servant, concerning this matter. Kings : And he said to him, Go in peace. Then he went away from him, in the elect time of the earth. Kings : And Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, said: My lord has spared Naaman, this Syrian, by not receiving from him what he brought. As the Lord lives, I will run after him, and take something from him. Kings : And so, Gehazi followed after the back of Naaman. And when he had seen him running toward him, he leaped down from his chariot to meet him, and he said, Is all well? Kings : And he said: It is well. My lord has sent me to you, saying: Just now two youths from the sons of the prophets have come to me from mount Ephraim. Give them a talent of silver, and two changes of clothing. Kings : And Naaman said, It is better that you accept two talents. And he urged him, and he bound the two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of clothing. And he set them upon two of his servants, who carried them before him. Kings : And when now he had arrived in the evening, he took them from their hands, and he stored them in the house. And he dismissed the men, and they went away. Kings : Then, having entered, he stood before his lord. And Elisha said, Where are you coming from, Gehazi? He responded, Your servant did not go anywhere. Kings : But he said: Was my heart not present, when the man turned back from his chariot to meet you? And now you have received money, and you have received garments, so that you might buy olive groves, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and men and women servants. Kings : So then, the leprosy of Naaman shall adhere to you, and to your offspring forever. And he departed from him a leper, as white as snow. Kings : Now the sons of the prophets said to Elisha: Behold, the place in which we live before you is too narrow for us. Kings : Let us go as far as the Jordan, and let us each take from the forest a piece of timber, so that we may build for ourselves a place to live there. And he said, Go. Kings : And one of them said, Then you, too, should go with your servants. And he answered, I will go. Kings : And he went with them. And when they had arrived at the Jordan, they were cutting down wood. Kings : Then it happened that, while someone was cutting timber, the iron of the ax fell into the water. And he cried out and said: Alas, alas, alas, my lord! For this thing was borrowed. Kings : Then the man of God said, Where did it fall? And he indicated to him the place. Then he cut off a piece of wood, and he threw it in. And the iron floated up. Kings : And he said, Take it. And he extended his hand, and took it. Kings : Now the king of Syria was fighting against Israel, and he took counsel with his servants, saying, In this and that place, let us set up an ambush. Kings : And so the man of God sent to the king of Israel, saying: Take care not to pass by that place. For the Syrians are there in ambush. Kings : And so the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God had told him, and he prevented it. And he preserved himself, concerning that place, not merely once or twice. Kings : And the heart of the king of Syria was disturbed over this matter. And calling together his servants, he said, Why have you not revealed to me the one who is betraying me to the king of Israel? Kings : And one of his servants said: By no means, my lord the king! Rather it is the prophet Elisha, who is in Israel, who is revealing to the king of Israel every word whatsoever that you will speak in your conclave. Kings : And he said to them, Go, and see where he is, so that I may send and capture him. And they reported to him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan. Kings : Therefore, he sent horses, and chariots, and experienced soldiers to that place. And when they had arrived in the night, they encircled the city. Kings : Now the servant of the man of God, arising at first light, went out and saw the army all around the city, with horses and chariots. And he reported it to him, saying: Alas, alas, alas, my lord! What shall we do? Kings : But he responded: Do not be afraid. For there are more with us than with them. Kings : And when Elisha had prayed, he said, O Lord, open the eyes of this one, so that he may see. And the Lord opened the eyes of the servant, and he saw. And behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire, all around Elisha. Kings : Then truly, the enemies descended to him. But Elisha prayed to the Lord, saying: Strike, I beg you, this people with blindness. And the Lord struck them, so that they would not see, in accord with the word of Elisha. Kings : Then Elisha said to them: This is not the way, and this is not the city. Follow me, and I will reveal to you the man whom you are seeking. Then he led them into Samaria. Kings : And when they had entered into Samaria, Elisha said, O Lord, open the eyes of these ones, so that they may see. And the Lord opened their eyes, and they saw themselves to be in the midst of Samaria. Kings : And the king of Israel, when he had seen them, said to Elisha, My father, should I not strike them? Kings : And he said: You should not strike them. For you did not capture them with your sword or bow, so that you might strike them. Instead, set bread and water before them, so that they may eat and drink, and then go to their lord. Kings : And a great preparation of foods was placed before them. And they ate and drank. And he dismissed them. And they went away to their lord. And the robbers of Syria no longer came into the land of Israel. Kings : Now it happened that, after these things, Benhadad, the king of Syria, gathered together his entire army, and he ascended and was besieging Samaria. Kings : And a great famine occurred in Samaria. And it was blockaded for a long time, until the head of a donkey was sold for eighty pieces of silver, and one fourth part of a pint of pigeons dung sold for five silver coins. Kings : And as the king of Israel was passing by the wall, a certain woman cried out to him, saying, Save me, my lord the king! Kings : And he said: If the Lord does not save you, how am I able to save you? From the grain floor, or from the wine press? And the king said to her, What is the matter with you? And she responded: Kings : This woman said to me: Give your son, so that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow. Kings : Therefore, we cooked my son, and we ate him. And I said to her on the next day, Give your son, so that we may eat him. But she concealed her son. Kings : When the king had heard this, he tore his garments, and he passed along the wall. And all the people saw the haircloth that he had worn underneath, beside his flesh. Kings : And the king said, May God do these things to me, and may he add these other things, if the head of Elisha, the son of Shaphat, will remain on him this day! Kings : Now Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. And so he sent a man ahead. And before that messenger arrived, he said to the elders: Do you not know that this son of a murderer is sending someone to cut off my head? Therefore, watch, and when the messenger arrives, close the door. And you shall not permit him to enter. For behold, the sound of his lords feet is behind him. Kings : While he was still speaking to them, the messenger appeared who was sent to him. And he said: Behold, such a great evil is from the Lord! What more should I expect from the Lord? Kings : Then Elisha said: Listen to the word of the Lord. Thus says the Lord: Tomorrow, at this time, one measure of fine wheat flour will be one silver coin, and two measures of barley will be one silver coin, at the gate of Samaria. Kings : And one of the leaders, upon whose hand the king leaned, responding to the man of God, said, Even if the Lord will open the floodgates of heaven, how can what you say possibly be? And he said, You will see it with your own eyes, and you will not eat from it. Kings : Now there were four lepers beside the entrance of the gate. And they said one to another: Should we choose to stay here until we die? Kings : If we choose to enter the city, we will die from the famine. And if we remain here, we also will die. Therefore, come and let us flee over to the camp of the Syrians. If they spare us, we will live. But if they choose to kill us, we will die anyway. Kings : Therefore, they rose up in the evening, so that they might go to the camp of the Syrians. And when they had arrived at the beginning of the camp of the Syrians, they found no one in that place. Kings : For indeed, the Lord had caused them to hear, in the camp of Syria, the sound of chariots and horses, and a very numerous army. And they said one to another: Behold, the king of Israel has paid wages to the kings of the Hittites and of the Egyptians against us. And they will overwhelm us. Kings : Therefore, they rose up and fled away in the dark. And they left behind their tents and horses and donkeys in the camp. And they fled, desiring to save so much as their own lives. Kings : And so, when these lepers had arrived at the beginning of the camp, they entered one tent, and they ate and drank. And they took from there silver, and gold, and clothing. And they went away and hid it. And they returned again to another tent, and similarly, carrying away from there, they hid it. Kings : Then they said one to another: We are not doing the right thing. For this is a day of good news. If we remain silent and refuse to report it until morning, we will be charged with a crime. Come, let us go and report it in the court of the king. Kings : And when they had arrived at the gate of the city, they explained to them, saying: We went into the camp of the Syrians, and we found no one in that place, except horses and donkeys tied, and the tents still standing. Kings : Therefore, the gatekeepers went and reported it in the palace of the king. Kings : And he rose up in the night, and he said to his servants: I tell you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are suffering from famine, and therefore they have gone out from the camp, and they lie hidden in the fields, saying: When they will have gone out from the city, we will capture them alive, and then we will be able to enter the city. Kings : But one of his servants responded: Let us take the five horses that remain in the city for there were no more amid the entire multitude of Israel, since the rest had been consumed, and sending, we will be able to explore. Kings : Therefore, they brought two horses. And the king sent them into the camp of the Syrians, saying, Go, and see. Kings : And they went away after them, as far as the Jordan. But behold, the entire way was filled with clothing and vessels, which the Syrians had thrown aside when they were disturbed. And the messengers returned and told the king. Kings : And the people, going out, pillaged the camp of the Syrians. And one measure of fine wheat flour went for one silver coin, and two measures of barley went for one silver coin, in accord with the word of the Lord. Kings : Then the king stationed that leader, on whose hand he leaned, at the gate. And the crowd trampled him at the entrance of the gate. And he died, in accord with what the man of God had said when the king had descended to him. Kings : And this happened in accord with the word of the man of God, which he had spoken to the king, when he said: Two measures of barley will be one silver coin, and one measure of fine wheat flour will be one silver coin, at this same time tomorrow, at the gate of Samaria. Kings : Then that leader had responded to the man of God, and he had said, Even if the Lord will open the floodgates of heaven, how can what you say possibly happen? And he said to him, You will see it with your own eyes, and you will not eat from it. Kings : Therefore, it happened to him just as it had been predicted. For the people trampled him at the gate, and he died. Kings : Now Elisha spoke to the woman, whose son he had caused to live, saying: Rise up. Go, you and your household, and sojourn in whatever place you can find. For the Lord has called forth a famine, and it shall overwhelm the land for seven years. Kings : And she rose up, and she acted in accord with the word of the man of God. And going with her household, she sojourned in the land of the Philistines for many days. Kings : And when the seven years had ended, the woman returned from the land of the Philistines. And she departed, so that she might petition the king on behalf of her house and on behalf of her fields. Kings : Now the king was speaking with Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, saying, Describe for me all the great deeds that Elisha has done. Kings : And as he was describing for the king the manner in which he had raised the dead, the woman appeared, whose son he had restored to life, crying out to the king on behalf of her house and on behalf of her fields. And Gehazi said, My lord the king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha raised up. Kings : And the king questioned the woman. And she explained it to him. And the king appointed a eunuch to her, saying, Restore to her all that is hers, with all the proceeds of the fields, from the day that she left the land until the present. Kings : Also, Elisha arrived in Damascus, and Benhadad, the king of Syria, was ill. And they reported to him, saying, The man of God has arrived here. Kings : And the king said to Hazael: Take with you gifts. And go to meet the man of God. And consult the Lord through him, saying: Will I be able to escape from this, my infirmity? Kings : And so, Hazael went to meet him, having with him gifts, and all the goods of Damascus, the burdens of forty camels. And when he had stood before him, he said: Your son, Benhadad, the king of Syria, sent me to you, saying: Will I be able to be healed from this, my infirmity? Kings : And Elisha said to him: Go, tell him: You will be healed. But the Lord has revealed to me that, dying he shall die. Kings : And he stood beside him, and he was so troubled that his face became flushed. And the man of God wept. Kings : And Hazael said to him, Why is my lord weeping? And he said: Because I know the evil that you will do to the sons of Israel. Their fortified cities you will burn with fire. And their young men you will kill with the sword. And you will destroy their little ones, and tear open the pregnant women. Kings : And Hazael said, But what am I, your servant, a dog, that I would do this great thing? And Elisha said, The Lord has revealed to me that you will be the king of Syria. Kings : And when he had departed from Elisha, he went to his lord, who said to him, What did Elisha say to you? And he responded: He said to me, You shall receive health. Kings : And when the next day had arrived, he took a small covering, and poured water on it, and he spread it over his face. And when he died, Hazael reigned in his place. Kings : In the fifth year of Joram, the son of Ahab, the king of Israel, and of Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah: Jehoram, the son of Jehoshaphat, reigned as the king of Judah. Kings : He was thirty-two years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for eight years in Jerusalem. Kings : And he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had walked. For the daughter of Ahab was his wife. And he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. Kings : But the Lord was not willing to destroy Judah, because of David, his servant, just as he had promised him, so that he might grant a light to him and to his sons, for all days. Kings : In his days, Idumea drew apart, so as not to be under Judah, and they appointed a king for themselves. Kings : And so, Jehoram went to Zair, and all the chariots with him. And he rose up in the night, and he struck down the Idumeans who had surrounded him, and the leaders of the chariots. But the people fled to their tents. Kings : And Idumea drew apart, so as not to be under Judah, even to this day. Then Libnah also drew apart, at the same time. Kings : Now the rest of the words of Jehoram, and all that he did, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Judah? Kings : And Jehoram slept with his fathers, and he was buried with them in the city of David. And Ahaziah, his son, reigned in his place. Kings : In the twelfth year of Joram, the son of Ahab, the king of Israel: Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram, the king of Judah, reigned. Kings : Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for one year in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri, the king of Israel. Kings : And he walked in the ways of the house of Ahab. And he did what is evil before the Lord, just as the house of Ahab did. For he was the son-in-law of the house of Ahab. Kings : Also, he went with Joram, the son of Ahab, in order to fight against Hazael, the king of Syria, at Ramoth Gilead. And the Syrians had wounded Joram. Kings : And he turned back, so that he might be cured at Jezreel. For the Syrians had wounded him at Ramoth, fighting against Hazael, the king of Syria. Then Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram, the king of Judah, descended to visit Joram, the son of Ahab, at Jezreel, because he was sick there. Kings : Now the prophet Elisha called one of the sons of the prophets, and he said to him: Gird your waist, and take this little bottle of oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth Gilead. Kings : And when you arrive in that place, you will see Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi. And upon entering, you shall raise him up from the midst of his brothers, and you shall lead him into an inner room. Kings : And taking the little bottle of oil, you shall pour it upon his head, and you shall say: Thus says the Lord: I have anointed you as king over Israel. And you shall open the door and flee. And you shall not remain in that place. Kings : Therefore, the young man, a servant of the prophet, went away to Ramoth Gilead. Kings : And he entered that place, and behold, the leaders of the army were sitting there, and he said, I have a word for you, O prince. And Jehu said, For which one among us all? And he said, For you, O prince. Kings : And he rose up and entered into the room. And he poured the oil on his head, and he said: Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: I have anointed you as king over Israel, the people of the Lord. Kings : And you will shall strike down the house of Ahab, your lord. And I will avenge the blood of my servants, the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the Lord, from the hand of Jezebel. Kings : And I will destroy the entire house of Ahab. And I will cause to pass away from Ahab, whatever urinates against a wall, and whatever is lame, and whatever is least in Israel. Kings : And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha, the son of Ahijah. Kings : Also, the dogs will consume Jezebel, in the field of Jezreel. Neither will there be anyone who may bury her. And then he opened the door, and he fled. Kings : Then Jehu went out to the servants of his lord. And they said to him: Is everything well? Why has this insane man come to you? And he said to them, You know the man, and what he said. Kings : But they responded, That is false; instead, you should tell us. And he said to them, He said to me these certain things, and he said, Thus says the Lord: I have anointed you as king over Israel. Kings : And so they hurried away. And each one, taking his cloak, placed it under his feet, in the manner of a seat for judgment. And they sounded the trumpet, and they said: Jehu reigns! Kings : Then Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, conspired against Joram. Now Joram had besieged Ramoth Gilead, he and all of Israel, against Hazael, the king of Syria. Kings : And he had returned, so that he might be cured at Jezreel, because of his wounds. For the Syrians had struck him, while he was fighting against Hazael, the king of Syria. And Jehu said, If it pleases you, let no one depart, fleeing from the city; otherwise he may go and give a report in Jezreel. Kings : And he climbed up and set out for Jezreel, because Joram was sick there, and Ahaziah, the king of Judah, had gone down to visit Joram. Kings : And so the watchman, who was standing upon the tower of Jezreel, saw the crowd of Jehu arriving, and he said, I see a crowd. And Joram said: Take a chariot, and send to meet them. And those who go should say, Is everything well? Kings : Therefore, he who had climbed into the chariot went away to meet him, and he said, The king says this: Is everything peaceful? And Jehu said: What peace is there for you? Pass by and follow me. Also the watchman gave a report, saying, The messenger went to them, but he did not return. Kings : And then he sent a second chariot of horses. And he went to them, and he said, The king says this: Is there peace? And Jehu said: What peace is there for you? Pass by and follow me. Kings : Then the watchman gave a report, saying: He went all the way to them, but he did not return. But their advance is like the advance of Jehu, the son of Nimshi. For he advances precipitously. Kings : And Joram said, Yoke the chariot. And they yoked his chariot. And Joram, the king of Israel, and Ahaziah, the king of Judah, departed, each in his chariot. And they went out to meet Jehu. And they met him in the field of Naboth, the Jezreelite. Kings : And when Joram had seen Jehu, he said, Is there peace, Jehu? And he responded: What is peace? For still the fornications of your mother, Jezebel, and her many poisons, are thriving. Kings : Then Joram turned his hand, and, fleeing, he said to Ahaziah, Treachery, Ahaziah! Kings : But Jehu bent his bow with his hand, and he struck Joram between the shoulders. And the arrow went through his heart, and immediately he fell in his chariot. Kings : And Jehu said to Bidkar, his commander: Take and cast him into the field of Naboth, the Jezreelite. For I remember, when you and I, sitting in a chariot, were following Ahab, this mans father, that the Lord lifted this burden upon him, saying: Kings : Certainly, I will repay you in this field, says the Lord, for the blood of Naboth, and for the blood of his sons, which I saw yesterday, says the Lord. Therefore, take him now, and cast him into the field, in accord with the word of the Lord. Kings : But Ahaziah, the king of Judah, seeing this, fled along the way of the garden house. And Jehu pursued him, and he said, Strike this one also in his chariot. And they struck him on the ascent to Gur, which is beside Ibleam. But he fled into Megiddo, and he died there. Kings : And his servants placed him upon his chariot, and they took him to Jerusalem. And they buried him in the sepulcher with his fathers, in the city of David. Kings : In the eleventh year of Joram, the son of Ahab, Ahaziah reigned over Judah. Kings : And Jehu went into Jezreel. But Jezebel, hearing of his arrival, painted her eyes with cosmetics, and adorned her head. And she watched through a window, Kings : as Jehu was entering through the gate. And she said, Is it possible for there to be peace for Zimri, who killed his lord? Kings : And Jehu lifted up his face to the window, and he said, Who is this woman? And two or three eunuchs bowed down before him. Kings : And he said to them, Throw her down with force. And they threw her forcefully, and the wall was splattered with her blood, and the hoofs of the horses trampled her. Kings : And when he had entered, so that he might eat and drink, he said: Go, and see to that cursed woman, and bury her. For she is the daughter of a king. Kings : But when they had gone, so that they might bury her, they found nothing but the skull, and the feet, and the ends of her hands. Kings : And returning, they reported to him. And Jehu said: It is the word of the Lord, which he spoke though his servant, Elijah the Tishbite, saying: In the field of Jezreel, the dogs will consume the flesh of Jezebel. Kings : And the flesh of Jezebel will be like dung upon the face of the earth, in the field of Jezreel, so that those who pass by may say: Is this that same Jezebel? Kings : Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And so Jehu wrote letters, and he sent to Samaria, to the nobles of the city, and to those greater by birth, and to those who had raised Ahabs sons, saying: Kings : Immediately when you receive these letters, you who have your lords sons, and chariots, and horses, and reinforced cities, and weapons, Kings : choose him who is better and who pleases you from among the sons of your lord, and set him on the throne of his father, and fight for the house of your lord. Kings : But they were vehemently afraid, and they said: Behold, two kings were not able to stand before him. So how will we be able to withstand him? Kings : Therefore, those who were in charge of the house, and the prefects of the city, and those greater by birth, and those who raised the sons, sent to Jehu, saying: We are your servants. Whatever you will order, we will do. But we will not appoint a king for ourselves. Do whatever pleases you. Kings : Then he again wrote letters to them a second time, saying: If you are mine, and if you obey me, take the heads of the sons of your lord, and come to me at Jezreel at this same hour tomorrow. Now the sons of the king, being seventy men, were being raised with the nobles of the city. Kings : And when the letters had arrived to them, they took the sons of the king, and they killed the seventy men. And they placed their heads in baskets, and they sent these to him at Jezreel. Kings : Then a messenger arrived and reported to him, saying, They have brought the heads of the kings sons. And he responded, Place them in two piles, beside the entrance of the gate, until morning. Kings : And when it had become light, he went out. And standing there, he said to all the people: You are just. If I have conspired against my lord, and if I have killed him, who has struck down all of these? Kings : Now therefore, see that none of the words of the Lord has fallen to the ground, which the Lord spoke over the house of Ahab, and that the Lord has done what he spoke by the hand of his servant Elijah. Kings : And so, Jehu struck down all who had remained from the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his nobles and friends and priests, until no remnant of them was left behind. Kings : And he rose up and went to Samaria. And when he had arrived at the shepherds cabin along the way, Kings : he found the brothers of Ahaziah, the king of Judah, and he said to them, Who are you? And they responded, We are the brothers of Ahaziah, and we are going down to greet the sons of the king, and the sons of the queen. Kings : And he said, Take them alive. And when they had taken them alive, they cut their throats at the cistern beside the cabin, forty-two men. And he did not leave any of them behind. Kings : And when he had gone away from there, he found Jehonadab, the son of Rechab, coming to meet him, and he blessed him. And he said to him, Is your heart upright, just as my heart is with your heart? And Jehonadab said, It is. Then he said, If it is, then give me your hand. He gave his hand to him. And so he lifted him up to himself in the chariot. Kings : And he said to him, Come with me, and see my zeal for the Lord. And he gave him a place in his chariot. Kings : And he led him into Samaria. And he struck down all who were left behind of Ahab in Samaria, even to the last one, in accord with the word of the Lord, which he spoke through Elijah. Kings : Then Jehu gathered together the entire people. And he said to them: Ahab worshipped Baal a little, but I will worship him even more. Kings : Now therefore, summon to me all the prophets of Baal, and all his servants, and all his priests. Let no one be permitted not to come, for great is the sacrifice from me to Baal. Whoever will fail to come, he shall not live. Now Jehu was doing this treacherously, so that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal. Kings : And he said: Sanctify a day of solemnity for Baal. And he summoned Kings : and sent into all the borders of Israel. And all the servants of Baal came. There was left behind not even one who did not arrive. And they entered into the temple of Baal. And the house of Baal was filled, all the way from end to end. Kings : And he said to those who were over the vestments, Bring forth vestments for all the servants of Baal. And they brought forth vestments for them. Kings : And Jehu, upon entering the temple of Baal with Jehonadab, the son of Rechab, said to the worshippers of Baal, Inquire and see that there is no one with you from the servants of the Lord, but only from the servants of Baal. Kings : Then they entered, so that they might offer victims and holocausts. But Jehu had prepared for himself eighty men outside. And he had said to them, If anyone escapes from among these men, whom I have led into your hands, your life will take the place of his life. Kings : Then it happened that, when the holocaust had been completed, Jehu ordered his soldiers and officers, saying: Enter and strike them down. Let no one escape. And the soldiers and officers struck them down with the edge of the sword, and they cast them out. And they went into the city of the temple of Baal, Kings : and they took away the statue from the shine of Baal, and they burned it up Kings : and crushed it. They also tore down the temple of Baal, and they made it into a latrine, even to this day. Kings : And thus did Jehu wipe away Baal from Israel. Kings : Yet truly, he did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin. Neither did he forsake the golden calves, which were in Bethel and Dan. Kings : Then the Lord said to Jehu: Since you have diligently carried out what was right and pleasing in my eyes, and since you have accomplished, against the house of Ahab, all that was in my heart, your sons shall sit upon the throne of Israel, even to the fourth generation. Kings : But Jehu did not take care, so that he might walk in the law of the Lord, the God of Israel, with all his heart. For he did not withdraw from the sins of Jeroboam, who had caused Israel to sin. Kings : In those days, the Lord began to be weary of Israel. And Hazael struck them throughout all the parts of Israel, Kings : from the Jordan opposite the eastern region, in all the land of Gilead, and Gad, and Reuben, and Manasseh, from Aroer, which is above the torrent Arnon, in both Gilead and Bashan. Kings : But the rest of the words of Jehu, and all that he did, and his strength, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel? Kings : And Jehu slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz, his son, reigned in his place. Kings : Now the days during which Jehu reigned over Israel, in Samaria, were twenty-eight years. Kings : Truly, Athaliah, the mother of Ahaziah, seeing that her son was dead, rose up and put to death all the royal offspring. Kings : But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, the sister of Ahaziah, taking Jehoash, the son of Ahaziah, stole him away from the midst of the sons of the king who were being killed, out of the bedroom, with his nurse. And she hid him from the face of Athaliah, so that he would not be killed. Kings : And he was with her for six years, hidden in the house of the Lord. But Athaliah reigned over the land. Kings : Then, in the seventh year, Jehoiada sent for and took centurions and soldiers, and he brought them to himself in the temple of the Lord. And he formed a pact with them. And taking an oath with them in the house of the Lord, he revealed to them the son of the king. Kings : And he commanded them, saying: This is the word that you must do. Kings : Let one third part of you enter on the Sabbath, and keep watch on the house of the king. And let one third part be at the gate of Sur. And let one third part be at the gate behind the dwelling place of the shield bearers. And you shall keep the watch on the house of Mesha. Kings : Yet truly, let two parts of you, all who depart on the Sabbath, keep watch over the house of the Lord concerning the king. Kings : And you shall surround him, having weapons in your hands. But if anyone will have entered the precinct of the temple, let him be killed. And you shall be with the king, entering and departing. Kings : And the centurions acted in accord with all the things that Jehoiada, the priest, had instructed them. And taking each one of their men who would enter on the Sabbath, with those who would depart on the Sabbath, they went to Jehoiada, the priest. Kings : And he gave to them the spears and weapons of king David, which were in the house of the Lord. Kings : And they stood, each one having his weapons in his hand, before the right side of the temple, all the way to the left side of the altar and of the shrine, surrounding the king. Kings : And he led forth the son of the king. And he placed the diadem on him, and the testimony. And they made him king, and they anointed him. And clapping their hands, they said: The king lives! Kings : Then Athaliah heard the sound of the people running. And entering to the crowd at the temple of the Lord, Kings : she saw the king standing upon a tribunal, according to custom, and the singers and trumpets near him, and all the people of the land rejoicing and sounding the trumpets. And she tore her garments, and she cried out: Conspiracy! Conspiracy! Kings : But Jehoiada gave orders to the centurions who were over the army, and he said to them: Lead her away, beyond the precinct of the temple. And whoever will have followed her, let him be struck with the sword. For the priest had said, Do not allow her to be killed in the temple of the Lord. Kings : And they laid hands on her. And they pushed her through the way by which horses enter, beside the palace. And she was killed there. Kings : Then Jehoiada formed a covenant between the Lord, and the king and the people, so that they would be the people of the Lord; and between the king and the people. Kings : And all the people of the land entered the temple of Baal, and they tore down his altars, and they thoroughly crushed the statues. Also, they killed Mattan, the priest of Baal, before the altar. And the priest placed guards in the house of the Lord. Kings : And he took the centurions, and the legions of the Cherethites and Pelethites, and all the people of the land, and together they led the king from the house of the Lord. And they went by way of the gate of the shield bearers into the palace. And he sat upon the throne of the kings. Kings : And all the people of the land rejoiced. And the city was quieted. But Athaliah was slain with the sword at the house of the king. Kings : Now Jehoash was seven years old when he had begun to reign. Kings : In the seventh year of Jehu, Jehoash reigned. And he reigned for forty years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Zebiah from Beersheba. Kings : And Jehoash did what was right in the sight of the Lord, during all the days that Jehoiada, the priest, taught him. Kings : Yet still he did not take away the high places. For the people were still immolating, and burning incense, in the high places. Kings : And Jehoash said to the priests: All of the money for the holy things, which has been brought into the temple of the Lord from those who pass by, which is offered for the price of a soul, and which they bring into the temple of the Lord willingly, from their own free heart: Kings : let the priests, according to their ranks, take and use it in order to repair the surfaces of the house, wherever they see anything in need of repair. Kings : And yet, even until the twenty-third year of king Jehoash, the priests did not repair the surfaces of the temple. Kings : And king Jehoash called the high priest, Jehoiada, and the priests, saying to them: Why have you not repaired the surfaces of the temple? Therefore, you may no longer accept money according to your ranks. Instead, return it in order that the temple may be repaired. Kings : And so the priests were prohibited from accepting any more money from the people to repair the surfaces of the house. Kings : And the high priest, Jehoiada, took a certain chest, and he opened a hole in the top, and he placed it beside the altar, to the right of those who were entering the house of the Lord. And the priests who kept the doors put all the money in it which was being brought into the temple of the Lord. Kings : And when they saw that there was a great amount of money in the chest, the scribe of the king and the high priest went up and poured it out. And they counted the money that was found in the house of the Lord. Kings : And they gave it out, by number and measure, to the hands of those who were over the masons of the house of the Lord. And they weighed it out to the carpenters and masons, to those who were working in the house of the Lord Kings : and restoring the surfaces, and to those who were cutting stones, and buying timber and stones to be cut, so that the repairs to the house of the Lord might be finished: for all that was needed toward the expenses in order to strengthen the house. Kings : Yet truly, from the same money, they did not make for the temple of the Lord water pitchers, or small hooks, or censers, or trumpets, or any vessel of gold or silver, from the money that was brought into the temple of the Lord. Kings : For it was given to those who were doing the work, so that the temple of the Lord might be repaired. Kings : And they did not ration the money to the men who received it in order to distribute it to the artisans. Instead, they bestowed it with faith. Kings : Yet truly, the money for offenses and the money for sins, they did not bring into the temple of the Lord, since it was for the priests. Kings : Then Hazael, the king of Syria, ascended and fought against Gath, and he captured it. And he directed his face, so that he might ascend against Jerusalem. Kings : For this reason, Jehoash, the king of Judah, took all the sanctified things, which Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, the kings of Judah, had consecrated and which he himself had offered, and all the silver that could be found in the treasuries of the temple of the Lord and in the palace of the king, and he sent it to Hazael, the king of Syria. And so he withdrew from Jerusalem. Kings : Now the rest of the words of Jehoash, and all that he did, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Judah? Kings : Then his servants rose up and conspired among themselves. And they struck down Jehoash, at the house of Millo, on the descent of Silla. Kings : For Jozacar, the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad, the son of Shomer, his servants, struck him, and he died. And they buried him with his fathers in the city of David. And Amaziah, his son, reigned in his place. Kings : In the twenty-third year of Joash, the son of Ahaziah, the king of Judah, Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, reigned over Israel, in Samaria, for seventeen years. Kings : And he did evil before the Lord. And he followed the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin. And he did not turn aside from these. Kings : And the fury of the Lord was enraged against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael, the king of Syria, and into the hand of Benhadad, the son of Hazael, during all the days. Kings : But Jehoahaz petitioned the face of the Lord, and the Lord heeded him. For he saw the anguish of Israel, because the king of Syria had oppressed them. Kings : And the Lord gave a savior to Israel. And they were freed from the hand of the king of Syria. And the sons of Israel lived in their tabernacles, just as yesterday and the day before. Kings : Yet truly, they did not withdraw from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who had caused Israel to sin. Instead, they walked by them. And there was even a sacred grove still remaining in Samaria. Kings : And there was left to Jehoahaz from the people nothing but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand foot soldiers. For the king of Syria had killed them, and he had reduced them to become like dust on a threshing floor. Kings : But the rest of the words of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his strength, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel? Kings : And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria. And Joash, his son, reigned in his place. Kings : In the thirty-seventh year of Jehoash, the king of Judah, Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, reigned over Israel, in Samaria, for sixteen years. Kings : And he did what is evil in the sight of the Lord. He did not turn aside from all the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin. Instead, he walked by them. Kings : But the rest of the words of Joash, and all that he did, and his strength, the manner in which he fought against Amaziah, the king of Judah, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel? Kings : And Joash slept with his fathers. Then Jeroboam sat upon his throne. And Joash was buried in Samaria, with the kings of Israel. Kings : Now Elisha was sick of the infirmity from which he also died. And Joash, the king of Israel, descended to him. And he was weeping before him, and saying: My father, my father! The chariot of Israel and its driver! Kings : And Elisha said to him, Bring a bow and arrows. And when he had brought a bow and arrows to him, Kings : he said to the king of Israel, Place your hand upon the bow. And when he had placed his hand, Elisha place his own hands over the hands of the king. Kings : And he said, Open the window toward the east. And when he had opened it, Elisha said, Shoot an arrow. And he shot it. And Elisha said: It is the arrow of the salvation of the Lord, and the arrow of salvation against Syria. And you shall strike the Syrians at Aphek, until you consume them. Kings : And he said, Take the arrows. And when he had taken them, he then said to him, Strike an arrow against the ground. And when he had struck three times, and he had stood still, Kings : the man of God became angry against him. And he said: If you had struck five or six or seven times, you would have struck down Syria, even until it was consumed. But now you will strike it three times. Kings : Then Elisha died, and they buried him. And the robbers from Moab came into the land in the same year. Kings : But certain ones who were burying a man saw the robbers, and they cast the dead body into the sepulcher of Elisha. But when it had touched the bones of Elisha, the man revived, and he stood upon his feet. Kings : Now Hazael, the king of Syria, afflicted Israel during all the days of Jehoahaz. Kings : But the Lord took pity on them, and he returned to them, because of his covenant, which he had made with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob. And he was not willing to destroy them, nor to cast them out completely, even to the present time. Kings : Then Hazael, the king of Syria, died. And Benhadad, his son, reigned in his place. Kings : Now Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz, by a just war, took the cities from the hand of Benhadad, the son of Hazael, which he had taken from the hand of Jehoahaz, his father. Jehoash struck him three times, and he restored the cities to Israel. Kings : In the second year of Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz, the king of Israel: Amaziah, the son of Jehoash, reigned as king of Judah. Kings : He was twenty-five years old when he had begun to reign. And he reigned for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Jehoaddin from Jerusalem. Kings : And he did what is right before the Lord, yet truly, not like David, his father. He acted in accord with all the things that his father Jehoash did, Kings : except for this alone: he did not take away the high places. For still the people were immolating, and burning incense, in the high places. Kings : And when he had obtained the kingdom, he struck down those of his servants who had killed his father, the king. Kings : But the sons of those who had been killed he did not put to death, in accord with what was written in the book of the law of Moses, just as the Lord instructed, saying: The fathers shall not die for the sons, and the sons shall not die for the fathers. Instead, each one shall die for his own sin. Kings : He struck down ten thousand men of Idumea, in the Valley of the Salt Pits. And he captured the Rock in battle, and he called its name Subdued by God, even to the present day. Kings : Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, the king of Israel, saying: Come, and let us see one another. Kings : And Jehoash, the king of Israel, sent a reply to Amaziah, the king of Judah, saying: A thistle of Lebanon sent to a cedar, which is in Lebanon, saying: Give your daughter as wife to my son. And the beasts of the forest, which are in Lebanon, passed by and trampled the thistle. Kings : You have struck and prevailed over Idumea. And your heart has lifted you up. Be content with your own glory, and be seated your own house. Why would you provoke evil, so that you would fall, and Judah with you? Kings : But Amaziah was not quieted. And so Jehoash, the king of Israel, went up. And he and Amaziah, the king of Judah, saw one another at Beth-shemesh, a town in Judah. Kings : And Judah was struck down before Israel, and they fled, each to their own tents. Kings : And truly, Jehoash, the king of Israel, captured Amaziah, the king of Judah, the son of Jehoash, the son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh. And he brought him to Jerusalem. And he breached the wall of Jerusalem, from the gate of Ephraim as far as the gate of the Corner, four hundred cubits. Kings : And he took away all the gold and silver, and all the vessels, which were found in the house of the Lord and in the treasuries of the king, and he returned to Samaria with hostages. Kings : But the rest of the words of Jehoash, which he accomplished, and his strength, with which he fought against Amaziah, the king of Judah, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel? Kings : And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and he was buried in Samaria, with the kings of Israel. And Jeroboam, his son, reigned in his place. Kings : Now Amaziah, the son of Jehoash, the king of Judah, lived for fifteen years after the death of Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz, the king of Israel. Kings : And the rest of the words of Amaziah, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Judah? Kings : And they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem. And he fled to Lachish. And they sent after him, to Lachish, and they killed him there. Kings : And they carried him away on horses. And he was buried in Jerusalem with his fathers, in the city of David. Kings : Then all the people of Judah took Azariah, at sixteen years from birth, and they appointed him as king in place of his father, Amaziah. Kings : He built up Elath, and he restored it to Judah, after which the king slept with his fathers. Kings : In the fifteenth year of Amaziah, the son of Jehoash, the king of Judah: Jeroboam, the son of Jehoash, the king of Israel, reigned, in Samaria, for forty-one years. Kings : And he did what is evil before the Lord. He did not withdraw from all the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin. Kings : He restored the borders of Israel, from the entrance of Hamath as far as the Sea of the Wilderness, in accord with the word of the Lord, the God of Israel, which he spoke through his servant, the prophet Jonah, the son of Amittai, who was from Gath, which is in Hepher. Kings : For the Lord saw the exceedingly bitter affliction of Israel, and that they were being consumed, even to those who were enclosed in prison, and even to the least ones, and that there was no one who would help Israel. Kings : But the Lord did not say that he would wipe away the name of Israel from under heaven. So instead, he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam, the son of Jehoash. Kings : But the rest of the words of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his strength, with which he went to battle, and the manner in which he restored Damascus and Hamath to Judah, in Israel, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel? Kings : And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, the kings of Israel. And Zechariah, his son, reigned in his place. Kings : In the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam, the king of Israel: Azariah, the son of Amaziah, reigned as king of Judah. Kings : He was sixteen years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for fifty-two years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Jecoliah of Jerusalem. Kings : And he did what was pleasing before the Lord, in accord with all that his father, Amaziah, did. Kings : Yet truly, he did not demolish the high places. And still the people were sacrificing, and burning incense, in the high places. Kings : Now the Lord struck the king, and he became a leper, even until the day of his death. And he was living in a separate house by himself. And truly, Jotham, the son of the king, governed the palace, and he judged the people of the land. Kings : Now the rest of the words of Azariah, and all that he did, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Judah? Kings : And Azariah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his ancestors in the city of David. And Jotham, his son, reigned in his place. Kings : In the thirty-eighth year of Azariah, the king of Judah: Zechariah, the son of Jeroboam, reigned over Israel, in Samaria, for six months. Kings : And he did what is evil before the Lord, just as his fathers had done. He did not withdraw from the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin. Kings : Then Shallum, the son of Jabesh, conspired against him. And he struck him openly, and killed him. And he reigned in his place. Kings : Now the rest of the words of Zechariah, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel? Kings : This was the word of the Lord, which he spoke to Jehu, saying: Your sons, even to the fourth generation, shall sit upon the throne of Israel. And so it happened. Kings : Shallum, the son of Jabesh, reigned in the thirty-ninth year of Azariah, the king of Judah. And he reigned for one month, in Samaria. Kings : And Menahem, the son of Gadi, ascended from Tirzah. And he went into Samaria, and he struck Shallum, the son of Jabesh, in Samaria. And he killed him, and reigned in his place. Kings : Now the rest of the words of Shallum, and his conspiracy, by which he carried out treachery, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel? Kings : Then Menahem struck Tirzah, and all who were in it, and its borders around Tirzah. For they were not willing to open to him. And he killed all of its pregnant women, and he tore them open. Kings : In the thirty-ninth year of Azariah, the king of Judah: Menahem, son of Gadi, reigned over Israel for ten years, in Samaria. Kings : And he did what was evil before the Lord. He did not withdraw from the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin, during all his days. Kings : Then Pul, the king of the Assyrians, came into the land. And Menahem gave Pul one thousand talents of silver, so that he would be a help to him, and so that he might strengthen his kingdom. Kings : And Menahem proclaimed a tax upon Israel, on all who were powerful and wealthy, so that each one would give to the king of the Assyrians fifty shekels of silver. Then the king of the Assyrians turned back, and he did not remain in the land. Kings : Now the rest of the words of Menahem, and all that he did, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel? Kings : And Menahem slept with his fathers. And Pekahiah, his son, reigned in his place. Kings : In the fiftieth year of Azariah, the king of Judah: Pekahiah, the son of Menahem, reigned over Israel, in Samaria, for two years. Kings : And he did what was evil before the Lord. He did not withdraw from the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin. Kings : Then Pekah, the son of Remaliah, his commander, conspired against him. And he struck him in Samaria, in the tower of the kings house, near Argob and Arieh, and with him fifty men from the sons of the Gileadites. And he killed him, and reigned in his place. Kings : Now the rest of the words of Pekahiah, and all that he did, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel? Kings : In the fifty-second year of Azariah, the king of Judah: Pekah, the son of Remaliah, reigned over Israel, in Samaria, for twenty years. Kings : And he did what was evil before the Lord. He did not withdraw from the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin. Kings : In the days of Pekah, the king of Israel, Tiglath-pileser, the king of Assyria, arrived and captured Ijon, and Abel Bethmaacah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, and the entire land of Naphtali. And he took them away into Assyria. Kings : Then Hoshea, the son of Elah, conspired and carried out treachery against Pekah, the son of Remaliah. And he struck him, and killed him. And he reigned in his place, in the twentieth year of Jotham, the son of Uzziah. Kings : Now the rest of the words of Pekah, and all that he did, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel? Kings : In the second year of Pekah, the son of Remaliah, the king of Israel: Jotham, son of Uzziah, reigned as king of Judah. Kings : He was twenty-five years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok. Kings : And he did what was pleasing before the Lord. In accord with all that his father, Uzziah, had done, so he did. Kings : Yet truly, he did not take away the high places. And still the people were immolating, and burning incense, in the high places. But he edified the gate of the house of the Lord to be very sublime. Kings : Now the rest of the words of Jotham, and all that he did, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Judah? Kings : In those days, the Lord began to send, into Judah, Rezin, the king of Syria, and Pekah, the son of Remaliah. Kings : And Jotham slept with his fathers, and he was buried with them in the city of David, his father. And Ahaz, his son, reigned in his place. Kings : In the seventeenth year of Pekah, the son of Remaliah: Ahaz, the son of Jotham, reigned as king of Judah. Kings : Ahaz was twenty years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. He did not do what was pleasing in the sight of the Lord, his God, as his father David did. Kings : Instead, he walked in the way of the kings of Israel. Moreover, he even consecrated his son, making him pass through fire, in accord with the idols of the nations that the Lord destroyed before the sons of Israel. Kings : Also, he was immolating victims, and burning incense, in the high places, and on the hills, and under every leafy tree. Kings : Then Rezin, the king of Syria, and Pekah, the son of Remaliah, the king of Israel, ascended to do battle against Jerusalem. And they besieged Ahaz, but they were not able to overcome him. Kings : At that time, Rezin, the king of Syria, restored Elath to Syria, and he expelled the Judeans from Elath. And the Idumeans went into Elath, and they have lived there, even to this day. Kings : Then Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser, the king of the Assyrians, saying: I am your servant, and I am your son. Ascend and accomplish my salvation from the hand of the king of Syria, and from the hand of the king of Israel, who have risen up together against me. Kings : And when he had collected the silver and the gold that could be found in the house of the Lord, and in the treasuries of the king, he sent it as a gift to the king of the Assyrians. Kings : And he agreed to his will. For the king of the Assyrians ascended against Damascus, and he laid waste to it. And he carried away its inhabitants to Cyrene. But Rezin he killed. Kings : And king Ahaz traveled to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser, the king of the Assyrians. And when he had seen the altar of Damascus, king Ahaz sent to Uriah, the priest, its pattern and likeness, according to all of its work. Kings : And Uriah, the priest, constructed an altar in accord with all that king Ahaz had commanded from Damascus. Uriah, the priest, did so, until king Ahaz arrived from Damascus. Kings : And when the king had arrived from Damascus, he saw the altar, and he venerated it. And he went up and immolated holocausts, with his own sacrifice. Kings : And he offered libations, and he poured out the blood of the peace offerings, which he had offered, upon the altar. Kings : But the altar of brass, which was before the Lord, he took away from the face of the temple, and from the place of the altar, and from the place of the temple of the Lord. And he positioned it at the side of the altar, toward the north. Kings : Also, king Ahaz instructed Uriah, the priest, saying: Upon the great altar, offer the morning holocaust, and the evening sacrifice, and the holocaust of the king, and his sacrifice, and the holocaust of the entire people of the land, and their sacrifices. But their libations, and all the blood of the holocaust, and all the blood of the victim, you shall pour out upon it. Then truly, the altar of brass shall be prepared for use at my will. Kings : And so Uriah, the priest, acted in accord with all that king Ahaz had instructed to him. Kings : Then king Ahaz took away the engraved bases, and the basin that was upon them. And he took down the sea from the bronze oxen, which were holding it up. And he positioned it upon a layer of pavement stone. Kings : Also, the canopy for the Sabbath, which he had built in the temple, and the exterior entrance of the king, he converted into the temple of the Lord, because of the king of the Assyrians. Kings : Now the rest of the words of Ahaz that he did, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Judah? Kings : And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and he was buried with them in the city of David. And Hezekiah, his son, reigned in his place. Kings : In the twelfth year of Ahaz, the king of Judah: Hoshea, the son of Elah, reigned over Israel, in Samaria, for nine years. Kings : And he did evil before the Lord, but not like the kings of Israel who had been before him. Kings : Shalmaneser, the king of the Assyrians, ascended against him. And Hoshea became a servant to him, and he paid him tribute. Kings : And when the king of the Assyrians discovered that Hoshea, striving to rebel, had sent messengers to Sais, to the king of Egypt, so as not to present the tribute to the king of the Assyrians, as he had been accustomed to do each year, he besieged him. And having been bound, he cast him into prison. Kings : And he wandered through the entire land. And ascending to Samaria, he besieged it for three years. Kings : And in the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of the Assyrians captured Samaria, and he carried away Israel to Assyria. And he stationed them in Halah and in Habor, beside the river of Gozan, in the cities of the Medes. Kings : For it happened that, when the sons of Israel had sinned against the Lord, their God, who had led them away from the land of Egypt, from the hand of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, they worshipped strange gods. Kings : And they walked according to the rituals of the nations that the Lord had consumed in the sight of the sons of Israel, and of the kings of Israel. For they had acted similarly. Kings : And the sons of Israel offended the Lord, their God, with deeds that were not upright. And they built for themselves high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city. Kings : And they made for themselves statues and sacred groves, on every high hill and under every leafy tree. Kings : And they were burning incense there, upon altars, in the manner of the nations that the Lord had removed from their face. And they did wicked deeds, provoking the Lord. Kings : And they worshipped impurities, concerning which the Lord instructed them that they should not do this word. Kings : And the Lord testified to them, in Israel and in Judah, through the hand of all the prophets and seers, saying: Return from your wicked ways, and keep my precepts and ceremonies, in accord with the entire law, which I instructed to your fathers, and just as I sent to you by the hand of my servants, the prophets. Kings : But they did not listen. Instead, they hardened their necks to be like the neck of their fathers, who were not willing to obey the Lord, their God. Kings : And they cast aside his ordinances, and the covenant that he formed with their fathers, and the testimonies which he testified to them. And they pursued vanities and acted vainly. And they followed the nations that were all around them, concerning the things which the Lord had commanded them not to do, and which they did. Kings : And they abandoned all the precepts of the Lord, their God. And they made for themselves two molten calves and sacred groves. And they adored the entire celestial army. And they served Baal. Kings : And they consecrated their sons and their daughters through fire. And they devoted themselves to divinations and soothsaying. And they delivered themselves into the doing of evil before the Lord, so that they provoked him. Kings : And the Lord became vehemently angry with Israel, and he took them away from his sight. And there remained no one, except the tribe of Judah alone. Kings : But even Judah did not keep the commandments of the Lord, their God. Instead, they walked in the errors of Israel, which they had wrought. Kings : And the Lord cast aside all of the offspring of Israel. And he afflicted them, and he delivered them into the hand of despoilers, until he drove them away from his face, Kings : even from that time when Israel was torn away from the house of David, and they appointed for themselves Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, as king. For Jeroboam separated Israel from the Lord, and he caused them to sin a great sin. Kings : And the sons of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam, which he had done. And they did not withdraw from these, Kings : even when the Lord carried away Israel from his face, just as he had said by the hand of all his servants, the prophets. And Israel was carried away from their land into Assyria, even to this day. Kings : Then the king of the Assyrians brought some from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Avva, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim. And he located them in the cities of Samaria, in place of the sons of Israel. And they possessed Samaria, and they lived in its cities. Kings : And when they had begun to live there, they did not fear the Lord. And the Lord sent lions among them, which were killing them. Kings : And this was reported to the king of the Assyrians, and it was said: The peoples that you transferred and caused to live in the cities of Samaria, they are ignorant of the ordinances of the God of the land. And so the Lord has sent lions among them. And behold, they have killed them, because they were ignorant of the rituals of the God of the land. Kings : Then the king of the Assyrians commanded, saying: Lead to that place one of the priests, whom you brought as a captive from there. And let him go and live with them. And let him teach them the ordinances of the God of the land. Kings : And so, when one of the priests, who had been led away captive from Samaria, had arrived, he lived in Bethel. And he taught them how they should worship the Lord. Kings : And each of the nations made gods of their own, and they placed them in the shrines of the high places, which the Samaritans had made: nation after nation, in their cities in which they were living. Kings : So the men of Babylon made Soccoth-benoth; and the men of Cuth made Nergal; and the men of Hamath made Ashima; Kings : and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak. Then those who were from Sepharvaim burned up their children with fire, for the gods of Sepharvaim: Adram-melech and Anam-melech. Kings : But nevertheless, they worshipped the Lord. Then they made for themselves, from the least of the people, priests of the high places. And they placed them in the shrines of the high places. Kings : And though they worshipped the Lord, they also served their own gods, according to the custom of the nations from which they had been transferred into Samaria. Kings : Even to the present day, they follow the ancient customs; they do not fear the Lord, and they do not keep his ceremonies, and judgments, and law, and commandment, which the Lord had instructed to the sons of Jacob, whom he named Israel. Kings : And he had struck a covenant with them, and he had commanded them, saying: You shall not fear foreign gods, and you shall not adore them, and you shall not worship them, and you shall not sacrifice to them. Kings : But the Lord, your God, who led you away from the land of Egypt, with great strength and with an outstretched arm, him shall you fear, and him shall you adore, and to him shall you sacrifice. Kings : Also, the ceremonies, and judgments, and law, and commandment, which he wrote for you, you shall keep so that you do them for all days. And you shall not fear strange gods. Kings : And the covenant, which he struck with you, you shall not forget; neither shall you worship strange gods. Kings : But you shall fear the Lord, your God. And he will rescue you from the hand of all your enemies. Kings : Yet truly, they did not listen to this. Instead, they acted in accord with their earlier custom. Kings : And such were these nations: to some extent fearing the Lord, yet nevertheless also serving their idols. As for their sons and grandsons, just as their fathers acted, so also did they act, even to the present day. Kings : In the third year of Hoshea, the son of Elah, the king of Israel: Hezekiah, the son of Ahaz, reigned as king of Judah. Kings : He was twenty-five years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Abi, the daughter of Zechariah. Kings : And he did what was good before the Lord, in accord with all that his father David had done. Kings : He destroyed the high places, and he crushed the statues, and he cut down the sacred groves. And he broke apart the bronze serpent, which Moses had made. For even until that time, the sons of Israel were burning incense to it. And he called its name Nehushtan. Kings : He hoped in the Lord, the God of Israel. And after him, there was no one similar to him, among all the kings of Judah, nor even among any of those who were before him. Kings : And he clung to the Lord, and he did not withdraw from his footsteps, and he carried out his commandments, which the Lord had instructed to Moses. Kings : Therefore, the Lord was also with him. And he conducted himself wisely in all the things to which he went forth. Also, he rebelled against the king of the Assyrians, and he did not serve him. Kings : He struck the Philistines as far as Gaza, and in all their borders, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city. Kings : In the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea, the son of Elah, the king of Israel: Shalmaneser, the king of the Assyrians, ascended to Samaria, and he fought against it, Kings : and he seized it. For after three years, in the sixth year of Hezekiah, that is, in the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Israel, Samaria was captured. Kings : And the king of the Assyrians took away Israel into Assyria. And he located them in Halah and in Habor, at the rivers of Gozan, in the cities of the Medes. Kings : For they did not listen to the voice of the Lord, their God. Instead, they transgressed his covenant. All that Moses, the servant of the Lord, had instructed, they would neither hear, nor do. Kings : In the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, Sennacherib, the king of the Assyrians, went up to all the fortified cities of Judah, and he captured them. Kings : Then Hezekiah, the king of Judah, sent messengers to the king of the Assyrians at Lachish, saying: I have offended. Withdraw from me, and all that you will impose upon me, I will bear. And so the king of the Assyrians levied a tax upon Hezekiah, the king of Judah, of three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold. Kings : And Hezekiah gave all the silver that had been found in the house of the Lord, and in the treasuries of the king. Kings : At that time, Hezekiah broke apart the doors of the temple of the Lord, with the plates of gold which he had affixed to them. And he gave these to the king of the Assyrians. Kings : Then the king of the Assyrians sent Tartan, and Rabsaris, and Rabshakeh, from Lachish, to king Hezekiah, with a powerful hand, to Jerusalem. And when they had ascended, they arrived in Jerusalem, and they stood beside the aqueduct of the upper pool, which is along the way of the fullers field. Kings : And they called for the king. But there went out to them Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, the first ruler of the house, and Shebnah, the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the keeper of records. Kings : And Rabshakeh said to them: Speak to Hezekiah: Thus says the great king, the king of the Assyrians: What is this faith, in which you strive? Kings : Perhaps, you have taken counsel, so that you would prepare yourself for battle. In whom do you trust, so that you would dare to rebel? Kings : Do you hope in Egypt, that staff of a broken reed, which, if a man would lean upon it, breaking, it would pierce his hand? Such is Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, to all who would trust in him. Kings : But if you say to me: We have faith in the Lord, our God. Is it not he, whose high places and altars Hezekiah has taken away? And did he not instruct Judah and Jerusalem: You shall adore before this altar in Jerusalem? Kings : Now therefore, cross over to my lord, the king of the Assyrians, and I will give to you two thousand horses, and we will see if you even have enough riders for them. Kings : So how can you resist one prince from the least of my lords servants? Do you have faith in Egypt because of the chariots and horsemen? Kings : Is it not by the will of the Lord that I have chosen to ascend to this place, so that I may destroy it? The Lord said to me: Ascend to this land, and destroy it. Kings : Then Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, and Shebnah, and Joah, said to Rabshakeh: We beseech you, that you may speak to us, your servants, in Syriac. For we understand that language to some extent. And do not speak to us in the Jews language, in the hearing of the people, who are upon the wall. Kings : And Rabshakeh responded to them, saying: Has my lord sent me to your lord and to you, so that I may speak these words, and not instead to the men who are sitting upon the wall, so that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own urine with you? Kings : And so, Rabshakeh stood up, and he exclaimed in a great voice, in the Jews language, and he said: Listen to the words of the great king, the king of the Assyrians. Kings : Thus says the king: Let not Hezekiah lead you astray. For he will not be able to rescue you from my hand. Kings : And do not let him give you faith in the Lord, saying: The Lord will rescue and free us, and this city will not be delivered into the hand of the king of the Assyrians. Kings : Do not choose to listen to Hezekiah. For thus says the king of the Assyrians: Do with me what is for your own good, and come out to me. And each one of you will eat from his own vine, and from his own fig tree. And you shall drink water from your own wells, Kings : until I arrive and transfer you into a land, similar to your own land, a fruitful and fertile land of wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olives and oil and honey. And you will live, and not die. Do not choose to listen to Hezekiah, who deceives you, saying: The Lord will free us. Kings : Have any of the gods of the nations freed their land from the hand of the king of Assyria? Kings : Where is the god of Hamath, and of Arpad? Where is the god of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and of Avva? Have they freed Samaria from my hand? Kings : Which ones among all the gods of the lands have rescued their region from my hand, so that the Lord would be able to rescue Jerusalem from my hand? Kings : But the people were silent, and they did not respond at all to him. For indeed, they had received an instruction from the king that they should not respond to him. Kings : And Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, the first ruler of the house, and Shebnah, the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the keeper of records, went to Hezekiah with their garments torn. And they reported to him the words of Rabshakeh. Kings : And when king Hezekiah had heard this, he tore his garments, and he covered himself with sackcloth, and he entered the house of the Lord. Kings : And he sent Eliakim, the first ruler of the house, and Shebnah, the scribe, and the elders from the priests, covered with sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz. Kings : And they said to him: Thus says Hezekiah: This day is a day of tribulation, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy. The sons are ready to be born, but the woman in labor does not have the strength. Kings : Perhaps the Lord, your God, may hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of the Assyrians, his lord, sent so that he would reproach the living God, and rebuke with words, which the Lord, your God, has heard. And so, offer a prayer on behalf of the remnant that has been found. Kings : And the servants of king Hezekiah went to Isaiah. Kings : And Isaiah said to them: So shall you say to your lord. Thus says the Lord: Do not be afraid before the face of the words that you have heard, by which the servants of the king of the Assyrians have blasphemed me. Kings : Behold, I will send a spirit to him, and he will hear a report, and he will return to his own land. And I will bring him down by the sword in his own land. Kings : Then Rabshakeh returned, and he found the king of the Assyrians fighting against Libnah. For he had heard that he had withdrawn from Lachish. Kings : And when he had heard from Tirhakah, the king of Ethiopia, saying, Behold, he has gone out so that he may fight against you, and when he went forth against him, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying: Kings : So shall you say to Hezekiah, the king of Judah: Let not your God, in whom you trust, lead you astray. And you should not say, Jerusalem will not be delivered into the hands of the king of the Assyrians. Kings : For you yourself have heard what the kings of the Assyrians have done to all the lands, the manner in which they have laid waste to them. Therefore, how would you alone be able to be freed? Kings : Have the gods of the nations freed any of those whom my fathers have destroyed, such as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the sons of Eden, who were at Telassar? Kings : Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, and of Hena, and of Avva? Kings : And so, when Hezekiah had received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and had read it, he ascended to the house of the Lord, and he spread it out before the Lord. Kings : And he prayed in his sight, saying: O Lord, God of Israel, who sits upon the cherubim, you alone are God, over all the kings of the earth. You made heaven and earth. Kings : Incline your ear, and listen. Open your eyes, O Lord, and see. And hear all the words of Sennacherib, who sent so that he might reproach the living God before us. Kings : Truly, O Lord, the kings of the Assyrians have devastated all peoples and lands. Kings : And they have cast their gods into the fire. For they were not gods, but instead were the works of mens hands, out of wood and stone. And so they destroyed them. Kings : Now therefore, O Lord our God, bring us salvation from his hand, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you alone are the Lord God. Kings : Then Isaiah, the son of Amoz, sent to Hezekiah, saying: Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: I have heard what you beseeched from me, concerning Sennacherib, the king of the Assyrians. Kings : This is the word that the Lord has spoken about him: The virgin daughter of Zion has spurned and ridiculed you. The daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head behind your back. Kings : Whom have you reproached, and whom have you blasphemed? Against whom have you exalted your voice, and lifted up your eyes on high? Against the Holy One of Israel! Kings : By the hand of your servants, you have reproach the Lord, and you have said: By the multitude of my chariots I have ascended to the heights of the mountains, to the summit of Lebanon. And I have cut down its sublime cedars, and its elect spruce trees. And I have entered even to its limits. And its forest of Carmel, Kings : I have cut down. And I drank foreign waters, and I dried up all the enclosed waters with the steps of my feet. Kings : But have you not heard what I have done from the beginning? From the days of antiquity, I have formed it, and now I have brought it to be. And fortified cities of fighting men will become piles of ruins. Kings : And whoever may settle in these, they have trembled, with a weak hand, and they have been confounded. They have become like the hay of the field, and like weeds sprouting on the rooftops, which dry up before they reached maturity. Kings : Your habitation, and your exit, and your entrance, and your way, I knew beforehand, along with your fury against me. Kings : You have been maddened against me, and your arrogance has ascended to my ears. And so, I will place a ring in your nose, and a bit between your lips. And I will lead you back along the way by which you came. Kings : But as for you, Hezekiah, this shall be a sign: Eat this year whatever you will find, and in the second year, whatever may spring up of itself. But in the third year, sow and reap; plant vineyards, and eat from their fruit. Kings : And whatever will have been left behind, from the house of Judah, shall send a root downward, and shall bear fruit upward. Kings : Indeed, a remnant shall go forth from Jerusalem, and what may be saved shall go forth from mount Zion. The zeal of the Lord of hosts shall accomplish this. Kings : For this reason, thus says the Lord about the king of the Assyrians: He shall not enter into this city, nor shoot an arrow into it, nor overtake it with the shield, nor encircle it with fortifications. Kings : By the way that he came, so shall he return. And he shall not enter this city, says the Lord. Kings : And I will protect this city, and I will save it for my own sake, and for the sake of my servant David. Kings : And so it happened that, in the same night, an Angel of the Lord went and struck down, in the camp of the Assyrians, one hundred and eighty-five thousand. And when he had risen up, at first light, he saw all the bodies of the dead. And withdrawing, he went away. Kings : And Sennacherib, the king of the Assyrians, returned and dwelled in Nineveh. Kings : And while he was worshipping in the temple of his god, Nisroch, his sons, Adram-melech and Sharezer, struck him with the sword. And they fled into the land of the Armenians. And Esarhaddon, his son, reigned in his place. Kings : In those days, Hezekiah was sick unto death. And the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz, came and said to him: Thus says the Lord God: Instruct your house, for you will die, and not live. Kings : And he turned his face to the wall, and he prayed to the Lord, saying: Kings : I beg you, O Lord, I beseech you, remember how I have walked before you in truth, and with a perfect heart, and how I have done what is pleasing before you. And then Hezekiah wept with a great weeping. Kings : And before Isaiah departed from the middle part of the atrium, the word of the Lord came to him, saying: Kings : Return and tell Hezekiah, the leader of my people: Thus says the Lord, the God of your father David: I have heard your prayer, and I have seen your tears. And behold, I have healed you. On the third day, you shall ascend to the temple of the Lord. Kings : And I will add fifteen years to your days. Then too, I will free you and this city from the hand of the king of the Assyrians. And I will protect this city for my own sake, and for the sake of my servant David. Kings : And Isaiah said, Bring me a mass of figs. And when they had brought it, and they had placed it on his sore, he was healed. Kings : But Hezekiah had said to Isaiah, What will be the sign that the Lord will heal me, and that I will ascend to the temple of the Lord on the third day? Kings : And Isaiah said to him: This will be the sign from the Lord, that the Lord will do the word that he has spoken: Do you wish that the shadow may ascend ten lines, or that it may turn back for the same number of degrees? Kings : And Hezekiah said: It is an easy for the shadow to increase for ten lines. And so I do not wish that this be done. Instead, let it turn back for ten degrees. Kings : And so the prophet Isaiah called upon the Lord. And he led back the shadow, along the lines by which it had already descended on the sundial of Ahaz, in reverse for ten degrees. Kings : At that time, Merodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, the king of the Babylonians, sent letters and gifts to Hezekiah. For he had heard that Hezekiah had been ill. Kings : Now Hezekiah rejoiced at their arrival, and so he revealed to them the house of aromatic spices, and the gold and silver, and the various pigments and ointments, and the house of his vessels, and all that he was able to have in his treasuries. There was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominions, that Hezekiah did not show to them. Kings : Then the prophet Isaiah came to king Hezekiah, and said to him: What did these men say? And from where did they come to you? And Hezekiah said to him, They came to me from Babylon, from a far away land. Kings : And he responded, What did they see in your house? And Hezekiah said: They saw all things whatsoever that are in my house. There is nothing in my treasuries that I did not show to them. Kings : And so Isaiah said to Hezekiah: Listen to the word of the Lord. Kings : Behold, the days are coming when all that is in your house, and all that your fathers have stored up even to this day, will be carried away to Babylon. Nothing at all shall remain, says the Lord. Kings : Then too, they will take from your sons, who will go forth from you, whom you will conceive. And they will be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon. Kings : Hezekiah said to Isaiah: The word of the Lord, which you have spoken, is good. Let peace and truth be in my days. Kings : Now the rest of the words of Hezekiah, and all his strength, and how he made a pool, and an aqueduct, and how he brought waters into the city, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Judah? Kings : And Hezekiah slept with his fathers. And Manasseh, his son, reigned in his place. Kings : Manasseh was twelve years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for fifty-five years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Hephzibah. Kings : And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, in accord with the idols of the nations that the Lord destroyed before the face of the sons of Israel. Kings : And he turned away. And he built up the high places that his father, Hezekiah, had destroyed. And he erected altars to Baal, and he made sacred groves, just as Ahab, the king of Israel, had done. And he adored the entire army of heaven, and he served them. Kings : And he constructed altars in the house of the Lord, about which the Lord said: In Jerusalem, I will place my name. Kings : And he constructed altars, for the entire army of heaven, within the two courts of the temple of the Lord. Kings : And he led his son through fire. And he used divinations, and observed omens, and appointed soothsayers, and multiplied diviners, so that he did evil before the Lord, and provoked him. Kings : Also, he set up an idol, of the sacred grove that he had made, in the temple of the Lord, about which the Lord said to David, and to his son Solomon: In this temple, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will place my name forever. Kings : And I will no longer cause the feet of Israel to be moved from the land that I gave to their fathers: if only they will take care to do all that I have instructed them, and the entire law that my servant Moses commanded to them. Kings : Yet truly, they did not listen. Instead, they were seduced by Manasseh, so that they did evil, more so than the nations that the Lord crushed before the face of the sons of Israel. Kings : And so the Lord spoke, by the hand of his servants, the prophets, saying: Kings : Since Manasseh, the king of Judah, has committed these wicked abominations, beyond all that the Amorites before him have done, and also has caused Judah to sin by his defilements, Kings : because of this, thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Behold, I will lead evils over Jerusalem and over Judah, such that, whoever will hear of these things, both his ears will ring. Kings : And I will extend the measuring line of Samaria over Jerusalem, with the scale of the house of Ahab. And I will erase Jerusalem, just as writing tablets are usually erased. And after erasing, I will turn it and repeatedly drag a stylus over its surface. Kings : And truly, I will send away the remnants of my inheritance, and I will deliver them into the hands of their enemies. And they will be devastated and plundered by all their adversaries. Kings : For they have done evil before me, and they have persevered in provoking me, from the day when their fathers departed from Egypt, even to this day. Kings : Moreover, Manasseh also has shed an exceedingly great amount of innocent blood, until he filled Jerusalem even to the mouth, aside from his sins by which he caused Judah to sin, so that they did evil before the Lord. Kings : Now the rest of the words of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Judah? Kings : And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza. And Amon, his son, reigned in his place. Kings : Amon was twenty-two years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for two years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz, from Jotbah. Kings : And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, just as his father, Manasseh, had done. Kings : And he walked in all the ways in which his father had walked. And he served the unclean things that his father had served, and he adored them. Kings : And he abandoned the Lord, the God of his fathers, and he did not walk in the way of the Lord. Kings : And his servants undertook treachery against him. And they killed the king in his own house. Kings : But the people of the land slew all those who had conspired against king Amon. And they appointed for themselves Josiah, his son, as king in his place. Kings : But the rest of the words of Amon, which he did, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Judah? Kings : And they buried him in his sepulcher, in the garden of Uzza. And his son, Josiah, reigned in his place. Kings : Josiah was eight years old when he had begun to reign. He reigned for thirty-one years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah, from Bozkath. Kings : And he did what was pleasing before the Lord, and he walked in all the ways of his father David. He did not turn aside to the right, or to the left. Kings : Then, in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, the king sent Shaphan, the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe of the temple of the Lord, saying to him: Kings : Go to Hilkiah, the high priest, so that the money may be put together which has been brought into the temple of the Lord, which the doorkeepers of the temple have collected from the people. Kings : And let it be given, by those in charge of the house of the Lord, to the workers. And let them distribute it to those who are working in the temple of the Lord in order to repair the surfaces of the temple, Kings : specifically, to carpenters and masons, and to those who mend gaps, and so that wood may be purchased, and stones from the quarries, in order to repair the temple of the Lord. Kings : Yet truly, let no account be given by them of the money that they receive. Instead, let them have it within their power and trust. Kings : Then Hilkiah, the high priest, said to Shaphan, the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord. And Hilkiah gave the volume to Shaphan, and he read it. Kings : Also, Shaphan, the scribe, went to the king, and reported to him what he had instructed. And he said: Your servants have brought together the money which was found in the house of the Lord. And they have given it so that it would be distributed to the workers by the overseers of the works of the temple of the Lord. Kings : Also, Shaphan, the scribe, explained to the king, saying, Hilkiah, the priest, gave the book to me. And when Shaphan had read it before the king, Kings : and the king had heard the words of the book of the law of the Lord, he tore his garments. Kings : And he instructed Hilkiah, the priest, and Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, and Achbor, the son of Micaiah, and Shaphan, the scribe, and Asaiah, the servant of the king, saying: Kings : Go and consult the Lord concerning me, and the people, and all of Judah, about the words of this volume which has been found. For the great wrath of the Lord has been kindled against us because our fathers did not listen to the words of this book, so that they would do all that has been written for us. Kings : Therefore, Hilkiah, the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah, went to Huldah, the prophetess, the wife of Shallum, the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, the keeper of the vestments, who was living in Jerusalem, in the second part. And they spoke with her. Kings : And she responded to them: Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Tell the man who sent you to me: Kings : Thus says the Lord: Behold, I will lead evils over this place, and over its inhabitants, all the words of the law that the king of Judah has read. Kings : For they have abandoned me, and they have sacrificed to foreign gods, provoking me by all the works of their hands. And so my indignation will be kindled against this place. And it will not be extinguished. Kings : But to the king of Judah, who sent you so that you would consult the Lord, so shall you say: Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: In so far as you have heard the words of the volume, Kings : and your heart was terrified, and you humbled yourself before the Lord, listening to the words against this place and its inhabitants, specifically, that they would become an astonishment and a curse, and because you have torn your garments, and have wept before me: I also have heard you, says the Lord. Kings : For this reason, I will gather you to your fathers, and you will be gathered to your sepulcher in peace, so that your eyes may not see all the evils that I will bring over this place. Kings : And they reported to the king what she had said. And he sent, and all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem were gathered to him. Kings : And the king ascended to the temple of the Lord. And with him were all the men of Judah and all who were living in Jerusalem: the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, from the small to the great. And in the hearing of everyone, he read all the words of the book of the covenant, which was found in the house of the Lord. Kings : And the king stood upon the step. And he struck a covenant before the Lord, so that they would walk after the Lord, and keep his precepts and testimonies and ceremonies, with all their heart and with all their soul, and so that they would carry out the words of this covenant, which had been written in that book. And the people agreed to the covenant. Kings : And the king instructed Hilkiah, the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the doorkeepers, so that they would cast out of the temple of the Lord all the vessels which had been made for Baal, and for the sacred grove, and for the entire army of heaven. And he burned them outside of Jerusalem, in the steep valley of Kidron. And he carried their dust into Bethel. Kings : And he destroyed the soothsayers, whom the kings of Judah had appointed to sacrifice in the high places throughout the cities of Judah, and all around Jerusalem, along with those who were burning incense to Baal, and to the Sun, and to the Moon, and to the twelve signs, and to the entire army of heaven. Kings : And he caused the sacred grove to be carried away from the house of the Lord, outside of Jerusalem, to the steep valley of Kidron. And he burned it there, and reduced it to dust. And he cast the dust over the graves of the common people. Kings : Also, he destroyed the small places of the effeminate, which were in the house of the Lord, for which the women were weaving something like little houses in the sacred grove. Kings : And he gathered together all the priests from the cities of Judah. And he defiled the high places, where the priests were sacrificing, from Geba as far as Beersheba. And he tore down the altars of the gates at the entrance to the gate of Joshua, the leader of the city, which was to the left of the gate of the city. Kings : Yet truly, the priests of the high places did not ascend to the altar of the Lord in Jerusalem. For they would only eat from the unleavened bread in the midst of their brothers. Kings : Also, he defiled Topheth, which is in the steep valley of the son of Hinnom, so that no one would consecrate his son or his daughter, through fire, to Molech. Kings : Also, he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the Sun, at the entrance to the temple of the Lord, beside the hallway of Nathan-melech, the eunuch, who was in Pharurim. And he burned the chariots of the Sun with fire. Kings : Also, the altars which were upon the roof of the upper room of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the temple of the Lord, the king destroyed. And he hurried from there, and he scattered their ashes into the torrent Kidron. Kings : Also, the high places which were in Jerusalem, to the right side of the Mount of Offense, which Solomon, the king of Israel, had built to Ashtoreth, the idol of the Sidonians, and to Chemosh, the offense of Moab, and to Milcom, the abomination of the sons of Ammon, the king defiled. Kings : And he crushed the statues, and he cut down the sacred groves. And he filled their places with the bones of the dead. Kings : Then too, the altar which was in Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin, had made: both that altar and the high place he tore down, and burned, and reduced to dust. And then he also set fire to the sacred grove. Kings : And in that place Josiah, turning, saw the sepulchers which were on the mount. And he sent and took the bones from the sepulchers. And he burned them upon the altar, and he defiled it in accord with the word of the Lord, which was spoken by the man of God, who had predicted these events. Kings : And he said, What is that monument that I see? And the citizens of that city responded to him: It is the sepulcher of the man of God, who came from Judah, and who predicted these events, which you have carried out concerning the altar of Bethel. Kings : And he said: Permit him. Let no one move his bones. And his bones have remained untouched, with the bones of the prophet who had arrived from Samaria. Kings : Then too, all the shines of the high places, which were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the Lord, Josiah took away. And he acted toward them according to all the works that he had done in Bethel. Kings : And all the priests of the high places, who were in that place, he killed upon the altars. And he burned the bones of the men upon them. And he returned to Jerusalem. Kings : And he instructed all the people, saying: Keep the Passover to the Lord your God, according to what has been written in the book of this covenant. Kings : Now no similar Passover was kept, from the days of the judges, who judged Israel, and from all the days of the kings of Israel and the kings of Judah, Kings : as this Passover, which was kept to the Lord in Jerusalem, in the eighteenth year of king Josiah. Kings : Then too, Josiah took away those who divined by spirits, and the soothsayers, and the images of the idols, and the defilements, and the abominations, which had been in the land of Judah and Jerusalem, so that he might establish the words of the law, which were written in the book, which Hilkiah, the priest, found in the temple of the Lord. Kings : There was no king before him similar to him, who returned to the Lord with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his strength, in accord with the entire law of Moses. And after him, there rose up no one similar to him. Kings : Yet truly, the Lord did not turn away from the wrath of his great fury, his fury which was enraged against Judah because of the provocations by which Manasseh had provoked him. Kings : And so the Lord said: And now I will remove Judah from my face, just as I removed Israel. And I will cast aside this city, Jerusalem, which I have chosen, and the house, about which I said: My name shall be there. Kings : Now the rest of the words of Josiah, and all that he did, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Judah? Kings : During his days, Pharaoh Neco, the king of Egypt, ascended against the king of the Assyrians to the river Euphrates. And king Josiah went out to meet him. And when he had seen him, he was killed at Megiddo. Kings : And his servants carried him dead from Megiddo. And they took him to Jerusalem, and they buried him in his own sepulcher. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz, the son of Josiah. And they anointed him, and made him king in place of his father. Kings : Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for three months in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah, from Libnah. Kings : And he did evil before the Lord, according to all that his fathers had done. Kings : And Pharaoh Neco bound him at Riblah, which is in the land of Hamath, so that he would not reign in Jerusalem. And he imposed a penalty on the land: one hundred talents of silver, and one talent of gold. Kings : And Pharaoh Neco appointed Eliakim, the son of Josiah, as king in place of Josiah his father. And he changed his name to Jehoiakim. Then he took Jehoahaz away, and he brought him into Egypt, and there he died. Kings : Now Jehoiakim gave silver and gold to Pharaoh, when he had taxed the land, according to each one who would contribute by the command of Pharaoh. And he exacted both silver and gold from the people of the land, from each one according to his ability, so that he would give to Pharaoh Neco. Kings : Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for eleven years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Zebidah, the daughter of Pedaiah, from Rumah. Kings : And he did evil before the Lord, in accord with all that his fathers had done. Kings : During his days, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, ascended, and Jehoiakim became his servant for three years. And again he rebelled against him. Kings : And the Lord sent to him the robbers of the Chaldeans, and the robbers of Syria, and the robbers of Moab, and the robbers of the sons of Ammon. And he sent them into Judah, so that they might destroy it, in accord with the word of the Lord, which he had spoken through his servants, the prophets. Kings : Then this occurred, by the word of the Lord against Judah, that he took him away from before himself because of all the sins of Manasseh which he did, Kings : and because of the innocent blood which he shed, and because he filled Jerusalem with the slaughter of the innocent. And for this reason, the Lord was not willing to be appeased. Kings : But the rest of the words of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Judah? And Jehoiakim slept with his fathers. Kings : And Jehoiachin, his son, reigned in his place. Kings : And the king of Egypt no longer continued to go out from his own land. For the king of Babylon had taken all that had belonged to the king of Egypt, from the river of Egypt as far as the river Euphrates. Kings : Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for three months in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan, from Jerusalem. Kings : And he did evil before the Lord, in accord with all that his father had done. Kings : At that time, the servants of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, ascended against Jerusalem. And the city was encircled with fortifications. Kings : And Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, went to the city, with his servants, so that he might fight against it. Kings : And Jehoiachin, the king of Judah, went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his leaders, and his eunuchs. And the king of Babylon received him, in the eighth year of his reign. Kings : And he took from there all the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the house of the king. And he cut up all the gold vessels which Solomon, the king of Israel, had made for the temple of the Lord, in accord with the word of the Lord. Kings : And he carried away all of Jerusalem, and all the leaders, and all the strong men of the army, ten thousand, into captivity, with every artisan and craftsman. And no one was left behind, except the poor among the people of the land. Kings : Also, he carried away Jehoiachin into Babylon, and the mother of the king, and the wives of the king, and his eunuchs. And he led into captivity the judges of the land, from Jerusalem to Babylon, Kings : and all the robust men, seven thousand, and the artisans and craftsman, one thousand: all who were strong men and fit for war. And the king of Babylon led them away as captives, into Babylon. Kings : And he appointed Mattaniah, his uncle, in his place. And he imposed the name Zedekiah upon him. Kings : Zedekiah held twenty-one years of life when he had begun to reign. And he reigned for eleven years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah, from Libnah. Kings : And he did evil before the Lord, in accord with all that Jehoiakim had done. Kings : For the Lord was angry against Jerusalem and against Judah, until he cast them away from his face. And so Zedekiah withdrew from the king of Babylon. Kings : Then it happened that, in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, he and his entire army, arrived against Jerusalem. And they encircled it, and they constructed fortifications all around it. Kings : And the city was enclosed and besieged, even until the eleventh year of king Zedekiah, Kings : on the ninth day of the month. And a famine prevailed in the city; neither was there bread for the people of the land. Kings : And the city was breached. And all the men of war fled in the night along the way of the gate which is between the double wall at the garden of the king. Now the Chaldeans were besieging the city on all sides. And so Zedekiah fled along the way which leads to the plains of the wilderness. Kings : And the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and they overtook him in the plains of Jericho. And all the warriors who were with him were dispersed, and they abandoned him. Kings : Therefore, having apprehended him, they led the king to the king of Babylon at Riblah. And he was speaking with him in judgment. Kings : Then he killed the sons of Zedekiah before him, and he dug out his eyes, and he bound him with chains, and he led him away to Babylon. Kings : In the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, the same is the nineteenth year of the king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan, the leader of the army, a servant of the king of Babylon, went into Jerusalem. Kings : And he set fire to the house of the Lord, and to the house of the king. And the houses of Jerusalem, and every great house, he burned with fire. Kings : And the entire army of the Chaldeans, which was with the leader of the military, tore down the walls of Jerusalem all around. Kings : Then Nebuzaradan, the leader of the military, carried away the rest of the people, who had remained in the city, and the fugitives, who had fled over to the king of Babylon, and the remnant of the common people. Kings : But he left behind some vinedressers and farmers from the poor of the land. Kings : Now the pillars of brass which were in the temple of the Lord, and the bases, and the sea of brass, which was in the house of the Lord, the Chaldeans broke apart. And they took all the brass to Babylon. Kings : Also, they took away the cooking pots of brass, and the scoops, and the forks, and the cups, and the little mortars, and all the articles of brass with which they were ministering. Kings : And the leader of the military even took away the censers and the bowls, whatever was of gold for the gold, and whatever was of silver for the silver, Kings : and also the two pillars, the one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made for the temple of the Lord. The brass of all these items was beyond measure. Kings : One pillar had eighteen cubits in height. And the head of brass upon it was three cubits in height. And the network and pomegranates upon the head of the pillar were all of brass. And the second pillar had a similar adornment. Kings : Also, the leader of the military took away Seraiah, the chief priest, and Zephaniah, the second priest, and three doorkeepers, Kings : and from the city, one eunuch, who was in charge of the men of war, and five men out of those who had stood before the king, whom he found in the city, and Sopher, the leader of the army who trained the young soldiers from the people of the land, and sixty men from the common people, who had been found in the city. Kings : Taking them, Nebuzaradan, the leader of the military, led them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. Kings : And the king of Babylon struck them and killed them at Riblah, in the land of Hamath. And Judah was taken away from his land. Kings : But over the people who had remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, had permitted, he appointed as ruler Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan. Kings : And when all the commanders of the military had heard this, they and the men who were with them, specifically, that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah, they went to Gedaliah at Mizpah: Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan, the son of Kareah, and Seraiah, the son of Tanhumeth, the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah, the son of a Maacathite, they and their companions. Kings : And Gedaliah swore to them and to their companions, saying: Do not be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Remain in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you. Kings : But it happened that, in the seventh month, Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of royal offspring, and ten men with him, went and struck Gedaliah, who then died, along with the Jews and the Chaldeans who were with him at Mizpah. Kings : And all the people, from small to great, and the leaders of the military, rising up, went away to Egypt, fearing the Chaldeans. Kings : Truly, it happened that, in the thirty-seventh year of the transmigration of Jehoiachin, the king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, Evilmerodach, the king of Babylon, in the year when he had begun to reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin, the king of Judah, from prison. Kings : And he spoke kindly to him. And he set his throne above the throne of the kings who were with him at Babylon. Kings : And he changed his garments that he had worn in prison. And he ate bread before him always, during all the days of his life. Kings : Also, he appointed to him an allowance without ceasing, which also was given to him by the king, for each day, during all the days of his life.

And Zimri conceived Moza. Chronicles : And Moza conceived Binea, whose son was Raphah, of whom was born Eleasah, who conceived Azel. Chronicles : Now there were six sons for Azel, whose names were Azrikam, Bocheru, Ishmael, Sheariah, Obadiah, and Hanan. All these were the sons of Azel. Chronicles : Then the sons of Eshek, his brother, were Ulam the firstborn, and Jeush the second, and Eliphelet the third. Chronicles : And the sons of Ulam were very robust men, drawing the bow with great strength. And they had many sons and grandsons, even to one hundred fifty. All these were sons of Benjamin. Chronicles : And so, all of Israel was numbered. And the sum of them was written in the book of the kings of Israel and of Judah. And they were taken away to Babylon because of their transgression. Chronicles : Now the first who lived in their possessions and in their cities were Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, and the temple servants. Chronicles : Staying in Jerusalem were some from the sons of Judah, and from the sons of Benjamin, and also from the sons of Ephraim and of Manasseh: Chronicles : Uthai, the son of Ammihud, the son of Omri, the son of Imri, the son of Bani, from the sons of Perez, the son of Judah.

Chronicles : Now the gatekeepers were Shallum, and Akkub, and Talmon, and Ahiman; and their brother Shallum was the leader. Chronicles : For until that time, at the gate of the king to the east, the sons of Levi served in their turns. Chronicles : Truly, Shallum, the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, with his brothers and his fathers house, these Korahites, were over the works of the ministry of keeping the vestibules of the tabernacle. And their families, in turns, were keepers of the entrance to the camp of the Lord. Chronicles : Now Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, was their ruler before the Lord. Chronicles : But Zechariah, the son of Meshelemiah, was the keeper of the gate of the tabernacle of the testimony. Chronicles : All these, chosen as porters for the gates, were two hundred twelve. And they were recorded in their own towns, those whom David, and the seer Samuel, appointed, in their faith, Chronicles : as with them, so also with their sons, at the gates of the house of the Lord and the tabernacle, by their turns. Chronicles : At the four directions, there were gatekeepers, that is, at the east, and at the west, and at the north, and at the south. Chronicles : Now their brothers were staying in the villages, and they arrived on their Sabbaths, from time to time. Chronicles : To these four Levites were entrusted the entire number of the gatekeepers, and they were over the chambers and storehouses of the house of the Lord. Chronicles : And they remained in their watches, on all sides of the temple of the Lord, so that, when the time had arrived, they might open the gates in the morning. Chronicles : Some from their kindred were also over the vessels of the ministry. For the vessels were both carried in and carried out according to number. Chronicles : Some of them also were entrusted with the equipment of the sanctuary; they were in charge of the fine wheat flour, and the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the aromatics. Chronicles : Now the sons of the priests composed the ointments from the aromatics. Chronicles : And Mattithiah, a Levite, the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, was in charge of those things that were cooked in a frying pan. Chronicles : Now some of the sons of Kohath, their brothers, were over the bread of the presence, so that they might continually prepare it new for each Sabbath. Chronicles : These are the leaders of the singing men, according to the families of the Levites, who were dwelling in the chambers, so that they might carry out their ministry continually, day and night. Chronicles : The heads of the Levites, leaders according to their families, abode in Jerusalem. Chronicles : Now in Gibeon, there lived Jeiel, the father of Gibeon, and the name of his wife was Maacah. Chronicles : His firstborn son was Abdon, and then Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and Ner, and Nadab, Chronicles : as well as Gedor, and Ahio, and Zechariah, and Mikloth. Chronicles : Then Mikloth conceived Shimeam. These lived opposite their brothers in Jerusalem, with their brothers. Chronicles : Now Ner conceived Kish, and Kish conceived Saul. And Saul conceived Jonathan, and Malchishua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal. Chronicles : And the son of Jonathan was Meribbaal. And Meribbaal conceived Micah. Chronicles : Now the sons of Micah were Pithon, and Melech, and Tahrea, and Ahaz. Chronicles : And Ahaz conceived Jarah. And Jarah conceived Alemeth, and Azmaveth, and Zimri. Then Zimri conceived Moza. Chronicles : Truly, Moza conceived Binea, whose son, Rephaiah, conceived Eleasah, from of whom was born Azel. Chronicles : Now Azel had six sons, whose names are: Azrikam, Bocheru, Ishmael, Sheariah, Obadiah, Hanan. These are the sons of Azel. Chronicles : Now the Philistines were fighting against Israel, and the men of Israel fled from the Philistines, and they fell down wounded on mount Gilboa. Chronicles : And when the Philistines had draw near, pursuing Saul and his sons, they struck down Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul. Chronicles : And the battle grew heavy against Saul. And the archers found him, and they wounded him with arrows. Chronicles : And Saul said to his armor bearer: Unsheathe your sword and kill me. Otherwise, these uncircumcised men may arrive and mock me. But his armor bearer was not willing, having been struck with fear. And so, Saul took hold of his sword, and he fell upon it. Chronicles : And when his armor bearer had seen this, specifically, that Saul was dead, he now fell on his sword also, and he died. Chronicles : Therefore, Saul died, and his three sons passed away, and his entire house fell, together. Chronicles : And when the men of Israel who were living in the plains had seen this, they fled. And since Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities and were dispersed, here and there. And the Philistines arrived and lived among them. Chronicles : Then, on the next day, when the Philistines were taking away the spoils of the slain, they found Saul and his sons, lying on mount Gilboa. Chronicles : And when they had despoiled him, and had cut off his head, and had stripped his armor, they sent these things into their land, so that they would be carried around and displayed in the temples of the idols and to the people. Chronicles : But his armor they consecrated in the shrine of their god, and his head they affixed in the temple of Dagon. Chronicles : When the men of Jabesh Gilead had heard this, specifically, all that the Philistines had done concerning Saul, Chronicles : each one of the valiant men rose up, and they took the bodies of Saul and of his sons. And they brought them to Jabesh. And they buried their bones under the oak that was in Jabesh. And they fasted for seven days. Chronicles : Thus did Saul die for his iniquities, because he betrayed the commandment of the Lord which he had instructed, and did not keep it. And moreover, he even consulted a woman diviner; Chronicles : for he did not trust in the Lord. Because of this, he caused his death, and he transferred his kingdom to David, the son of Jesse. Chronicles : Then all of Israel was gathered to David at Hebron, saying: We are your bone and your flesh. Chronicles : Also, yesterday and the day before, when Saul still reigned, you were the one who led out and brought in Israel. For the Lord your God said to you: You shall pasture my people Israel, and you shall be the leader over them. Chronicles : Therefore, all those greater by birth of Israel went to the king at Hebron. And David formed a pact with them before the Lord. And they anointed him king over Israel, in accord with the word of the Lord, which he spoke by the hand of Samuel. Chronicles : Then David and all of Israel went to Jerusalem. The same is Jebus, where the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, were. Chronicles : And those who were living in Jebus said to David: You shall not enter here. But David seized the stronghold of Zion, which is the city of David. Chronicles : And he said, Whoever shall strike the Jebusites first, shall be ruler and commander. And so Joab, the son of Zeruiah, ascended first, and he was made the leader. Chronicles : Then David lived in the stronghold, and for this reason it was called the City of David. Chronicles : And he built up the city all around, from Millo even to every side. But Joab built the rest of the city. Chronicles : And David continued advancing and increasing, and the Lord of hosts was with him. Chronicles : These are the leaders of the strong men of David, who assisted him, so that he would become king over all of Israel, in accord with the word of the Lord, which he spoke to Israel. Chronicles : And this is the number of the robust of David: Jashobeam, the son of a Hachmonite, leader among the thirty. He lifted up his spear over three hundred, who were wounded at one time. Chronicles : And after him, there was Eleazar, the son of his uncle, an Ahohite, who was among the three powerful ones. Chronicles : He was with David in Pasdammim, when the Philistines were gathered to that place for battle. Now the field of that region was full of barley, but the people had fled from the face of the Philistines. Chronicles : These men stood in the midst of the field, and they defended it. And when they had struck down the Philistines, the Lord gave a great salvation to his people. Chronicles : Then three from the thirty leaders descended to the rock where David was, to the cave of Adullam, when the Philistines had made camp in the Valley of the Rephaim. Chronicles : Now David was in a stronghold, and a garrison of the Philistines was in Bethlehem. Chronicles : And then David desired and said, O if only someone would give me water from the well of Bethlehem, which is at the gate! Chronicles : Therefore, these three broke through to the midst of the camp of the Philistines, and they drew water from the well of Bethlehem, which was at the gate. And they took it to David, so that he might drink. But he was not willing; and instead, he offered it as a libation to the Lord, Chronicles : saying: Far be it from me, that I would do this in the sight of my God, and that I would drink the blood of these men. For at the peril of their own lives, they brought the water to me. And for this reason, he was not willing to drink. The three most powerful accomplished these things. Chronicles : Also, Abishai, the brother of Joab, was the leader of the three, and he lifted up his spear against three hundred, who were wounded. And he was most renown among the three, Chronicles : and he was famous among the second three and their leader. Yet truly, he did not reach as far as the first three. Chronicles : Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, from Kabzeel, was a very mature man, who had accomplished many deeds. He struck down the two lions of God from Moab. And he descended and killed a lion in the middle of a pit, in the time of snow. Chronicles : And he struck down an Egyptian man, whose stature was five cubits, and who had a spear like a weavers beam. And yet he descended to him with a staff. And he seized the spear that he was holding in his hand. And he killed him with his own spear. Chronicles : These things were done by Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, who was most renowned among the three robust ones, Chronicles : the first among the thirty. Yet truly, he did not reach as far as the three. Then David placed him beside his ear. Chronicles : Moreover, the strongest men of the army were Asahel, the brother of Joab; and Elhanan, the son of his uncle, from Bethlehem; Chronicles : Shammoth, a Harorite; Helez, a Pelonite; Chronicles : Ira, the son of Ikkesh, a Tekoite; Abiezer, an Anathothite; Chronicles : Sibbecai, a Hushathite; Ilai, an Ahohite; Chronicles : Maharai, a Netophathite; Heled, the son of Baanah, a Netophathite; Chronicles : Ithai, the son of Ribai, from Gibeah, of the sons of Benjamin; Benaiah, a Pirathonite; Chronicles : Hurai, from the torrent Gaash; Abiel, an Arbathite; Azmaveth, a Baharumite; Eliahba, a Shaalbonite. Chronicles : The sons of Hashem, a Gizonite: Jonathan, the son of Shagee, a Hararite; Chronicles : Ahiam, the son of Sachar, a Hararite; Chronicles : Eliphal, the son of Ur; Chronicles : Hepher, a Mecherathite; Ahijah, a Pelonite; Chronicles : Hezro, a Carmelite; Naharai, the son of Ezbai; Chronicles : Joel, the brother of Nathan; Mibhar, the son of Hagri; Chronicles : Zelek, an Ammonite; Naarai, a Beerothite, the armor bearer of Joab, the son of Zeruiah; Chronicles : Ira, an Ithrite; Gareb, an Ithrite; Chronicles : Uriah, a Hittite; Zabad, the son of Ahlai; Chronicles : Adina, the son of Shiza, a Reubenite, the leader of the Reubenites, and thirty who were with him; Chronicles : Hanan, the son of Maacah; and Joshaphat, a Mithnite; Chronicles : Uzzia, an Ashterathite; Shama and Jeiel, the sons of Hotham, an Aroerite; Chronicles : Jediael, the son of Shimri; and Joha, his brother, a Tizite; Chronicles : Eliel, a Mahavite; and Jeribai and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam; and Ithmah, a Moabite; Chronicles : Eliel, and Obed, and Jaasiel from Mezobaite. Chronicles : Also, these went to David at Ziklag, while he was still fleeing from Saul, the son of Kish. And they were very strong and distinguished fighters, Chronicles : bending the bow, and using either hand in casting stones with slings, and shooting arrows. From the brothers of Saul, out of Benjamin: Chronicles : the leader was Ahiezer, with Joash, sons of Shemaah from Gibeah, and Jeziel and Pelet, sons of Azmaveth, and Beracah and Jehu, from Anathoth. Chronicles : Also, there was Ishmaiah, from Gibeon, the strongest among the thirty and over the thirty; Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and Jozabad, from Gederah; Chronicles : and Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealiah, and Shemariah, and Shephatiah, the Haruphites; Chronicles : Elkanah, and Isshiah, and Azarel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam, from Carehim; Chronicles : and also Joelah and Zebadiah, sons of Jeroham, from Gedor. Chronicles : Then too, from Gad, there went over to David, when he was hiding in the desert, very robust men, who were excellent fighters, taking hold of shield and spear; their faces were like the faces of a lion, and they were swift like the roe deer upon the mountains. Chronicles : Ezer was the leader, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third, Chronicles : Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth, Chronicles : Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh, Chronicles : Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth, Chronicles : Jeremiah the tenth, Machbannai the eleventh. Chronicles : These were from the sons of Gad, leaders of the army. The least was in charge of one hundred soldiers, and the greatest was in charge of one thousand. Chronicles : These are the ones who crossed over the Jordan in the first month, when it is accustomed to overflow its banks. And they put to flight all those who were staying in the valleys, to the eastern region and to the west. Chronicles : Then some from Benjamin and from Judah also arrived at the stronghold where David was staying. Chronicles : And David went out to meet them, and he said: If you have arrived peacefully, so as to be a help to me, may my heart be joined to you; but if to betray me to my adversaries, though I have no iniquity in my hands, may the God of our fathers see and judge. Chronicles : Truly, the Spirit clothed Amasai, the leader among the thirty, and he said: O David, we are yours! O son of Jesse, we are for you! Peace, peace to you, and peace to your helpers. For your God helps you. Therefore, David received them, and he appointed them as leaders of troops. Chronicles : Moreover, some from Manasseh crossed over to David, when he went forth with the Philistines against Saul, so that he might fight. But he did not fight with them. For the leaders of the Philistines, taking counsel, sent him back, saying, To the peril of our own heads, he will return to his lord, Saul. Chronicles : And so, when he returned to Ziklag, some fled over to him from Manasseh: Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Adnah, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zillethai, leaders of thousands in Manasseh. Chronicles : These offered assistance to David against the robbers. For all were very strong men, and they became leaders in the army. Chronicles : Then, too, some came to David throughout each day, in order to help him, until they became a great number, like the army of God. Chronicles : Now this is the number of the leaders of the army who went to David when he was at Hebron, so that they might transfer the kingdom of Saul to him, in accord with the word of the Lord: Chronicles : the sons of Judah, carrying shield and spear, six thousand eight hundred, equipped for battle; Chronicles : from the sons of Simeon, very strong men for the fight, seven thousand one hundred; Chronicles : from the sons of Levi, four thousand six hundred; Chronicles : as well as Jehoiada, a leader from the stock of Aaron, and with him three thousand seven hundred; Chronicles : and then Zadok, a youth of distinguished qualities, and the house of his father, twenty-two leaders; Chronicles : and from the sons of Benjamin, brothers of Saul, three thousand, for still a great part of them were following the house of Saul. Chronicles : Then from the sons of Ephraim, there were twenty thousand eight hundred, very strong and robust men, renowned among their kindred. Chronicles : And out of the one half tribe of Manasseh, eighteen thousand, each by their names, went forth so that they might appoint David as king. Chronicles : Also, from the sons of Issachar, there were learned men, who knew each of the times, in order to anticipate what Israel ought to do, two hundred leaders. And all the remainder of the tribe were following their counsel. Chronicles : Then, from Zebulun, there were those who went forth to battle, and who were standing in a battle line, prepared with the weapons of warfare; these fifty thousand arrived to assist, without duplicity of heart. Chronicles : And from Naphtali, there were one thousand leaders; and with them were thirty-seven thousand, prepared with shield and spear. Chronicles : And then from Dan, there were twenty-eight thousand six hundred, ready for battle. Chronicles : And from Asher, there were forty thousand, going forth to fight, and summoned to the battle line. Chronicles : Then, across the Jordan, there were, from the sons of Reuben, and from Gad, and from the one half tribe of Manasseh, one hundred twenty thousand, prepared with the weapons of warfare. Chronicles : All these men of war, equipped for the fight, went with a perfect heart to Hebron, so that they might appoint David as king over all of Israel. Then, too, all the remainder of Israel were of one heart, so that they might make David king. Chronicles : And they were in that place with David for three days, eating and drinking. For their brothers had made preparations for them. Chronicles : Moreover, those who were near to them, even as far as Issachar, and Zebulun, and Naphtali, were bringing, on donkeys and camels and mules and oxen, bread for their provisions, with grain, dried figs, dried grapes, wine, oil, and oxen and sheep, with all abundance. For indeed, there was joy in Israel. Chronicles : Then David took counsel with the tribunes, and the centurions, and all the leaders. Chronicles : And he said to the entire assembly of Israel: If it pleases you, and if the words that I speak come from the Lord our God, let us send to the remainder of our brothers, in all the regions of Israel, and to the priests and Levites who live in the suburbs of the cities, so that they may gather to us. Chronicles : And let us bring back the ark of our God to us. For we did not seek it during the days of Saul. Chronicles : And the entire multitude responded that it should be done. For the word had pleased all the people. Chronicles : Therefore, David gathered all of Israel, from Shihor of Egypt even to the entrance of Hamath, so as to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim. Chronicles : And David ascended with all the men of Israel to the hill of Kiriath-jearim, which is in Judah, so that he might bring from there the ark of the Lord God, sitting upon the Cherubim, where his name is invoked. Chronicles : And they placed the ark of God upon a new cart from the house of Abinadab. Then Uzzah and his brother drove the cart. Chronicles : Now David and all of Israel were playing before God, with all of their ability, in songs, and with harps, and psalteries, and timbrels, and cymbals, and trumpets. Chronicles : And when they had arrived at the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzzah reached out his hand, so that he might support the ark. For indeed, the ox being wanton had caused it to incline a little. Chronicles : And so the Lord became angry against Uzzah. And he struck him down because he had touched the ark. And he died there before the Lord. Chronicles : And David was greatly saddened because the Lord had divided Uzzah. And he called that place the Division of Uzzah, even to the present day. Chronicles : And then he feared God, at that time, saying: How will I be able to bring in the ark of God to myself? Chronicles : And for this reason, he did not bring it to himself, that is, into the City of David. Instead, he turned aside to the house of Obededom, the Gittite. Chronicles : Therefore, the ark of God dwelt in the house of Obededom for three months. And the Lord blessed his house and all that he had. Chronicles : Also, Hiram, the king of Tyre, sent messengers to David, and cedar wood, and artisans of walls and of wood, so that they might build a house for him. Chronicles : And David realized that the Lord had confirmed him as king over Israel, and that his kingdom had been lifted up over his people Israel. Chronicles : Also, David took other wives in Jerusalem. And he conceived sons and daughters. Chronicles : And these are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua and Shobab, Nathan and Solomon, Chronicles : Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpelet, Chronicles : as well as Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia, Chronicles : Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphelet. Chronicles : Then, hearing that David had been anointed as king over all of Israel, all the Philistines ascended so that they might seek him. But when David had heard of it, he went out to meet them. Chronicles : Now the Philistines, arriving, spread out in the Valley of the Rephaim. Chronicles : And so David consulted the Lord, saying, Shall I ascend to the Philistines, and will you deliver them into my hand? And the Lord said to him, Ascend, and I will deliver them into your hand. Chronicles : And when they had ascended to Baal-perazim, David struck them there, and he said: God has divided my enemies by my hand, just as waters are divided. And therefore the name of that place was called Baal-perazim. Chronicles : And they left behind their gods in that place, and so David ordered them to be burned. Chronicles : And then, at another time, the Philistines invaded, and they spread out in the valley. Chronicles : And again, David consulted God. And God said to him: You shall not ascend after them. Draw away from them. And you shall come against them opposite the balsam trees. Chronicles : And when you hear a sound approaching in the tops of the balsam trees, then you shall go forth to war. For God has gone forth before you, so that he may strike down the army of the Philistines. Chronicles : Therefore, David did just as God had instructed him. And he struck down the army of the Philistines, from Gibeon as far as Gazera. Chronicles : And the name of David became well-known in all the regions. And the Lord placed the fear of him over all the nations. Chronicles : Also, he made houses for himself in the City of David. And built a place for the ark of God, and he set up a tent for it. Chronicles : Then David said: It is illicit for anyone to carry the ark of God except the Levites, whom the Lord chose to carry it and to minister to himself, even unto eternity. Chronicles : And he gathered all of Israel in Jerusalem, so that the ark of God might be brought into its place, which he had prepared for it. Chronicles : Certainly, there were both the sons of Aaron and the Levites: Chronicles : From the sons of Kohath, Uriel was the leader, and his brothers were one hundred twenty. Chronicles : From the sons of Merari: Asaiah was the leader, and his brothers were two hundred twenty. Chronicles : From the sons of Gershom: Joel was the leader, and his brothers were one hundred thirty. Chronicles : From the sons of Elizaphan: Shemaiah was the leader, and his brothers were two hundred. Chronicles : From the sons of Hebron: Eliel was the leader, and his brothers were eighty. Chronicles : From the sons of Uzziel: Amminadab was the leader, and his brothers were one hundred twelve. Chronicles : And David summoned the priests, Zadok and Abiathar, and the Levites: Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab. Chronicles : And he said to them: You who are the leaders of the Levitical families, be sanctified with your brothers, and bring the ark of the Lord God of Israel to the place that has been prepared for it. Chronicles : Otherwise, as it was before, when the Lord struck us because you were not present, so also it might be now, if we do what is illicit. Chronicles : Therefore, the priests and the Levites were sanctified, so that they might carry the ark of the Lord God of Israel. Chronicles : And the sons of Levi took the ark of God, just as Moses had instructed, in accord with the word of the Lord, upon their shoulders by the bars. Chronicles : And David spoke to the leaders of the Levites, so that they might appoint, from their brothers, singers with musical instruments, specifically, psalteries, and harps, and cymbals, so that a joyful noise might resound on high. Chronicles : And they appointed from the Levites: Heman, the son of Joel; and from his brothers, Asaph, the son of Berechiah; and truly, from their brothers, the sons of Merari: Ethan, the son of Kushaiah. Chronicles : And with them were their brothers in the second rank: Zechariah, and Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jahiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, who were gatekeepers. Chronicles : Now the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were sounding out with cymbals of brass. Chronicles : And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah were singing mysteries with the psalteries. Chronicles : Then Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah and Obededom, and Jeiel and Azaziah were singing a song of victory with the harps, for the octave. Chronicles : Now Chenaniah, the leader of the Levites, was foremost over the prophecies, in order to mark out in advance the melodies. For indeed, he was very skillful. Chronicles : And Berechiah and Elkanah were porters of the ark. Chronicles : And the priests, Shebaniah, and Joshaphat, and Nethanel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, were sounding the trumpets before the ark of God. And Obededom and Jehiah were porters of the ark. Chronicles : Therefore, David, and all those greater by birth of Israel, and the tribunes, went to carry the ark of the covenant of the Lord from the house of Obededom with rejoicing. Chronicles : And when God had assisted the Levites, who were carrying the ark of the covenant of the Lord, they immolated seven bulls and seven rams. Chronicles : Now David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who were carrying the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah, the leader of the prophecy among the singers. But David was also clothed with a linen ephod. Chronicles : And all of Israel were leading back the ark of the covenant of the Lord with jubilation, sounding out with the noise of horns, and trumpets, and cymbals, and psalteries, and harps. Chronicles : And when the ark of the covenant of the Lord had arrived in the City of David, Michal, the daughter of Saul, gazing through a window, saw king David dancing and playing, and she despised him in her heart. Chronicles : And so they took the ark of God, and they set it in the midst of the tabernacle, which David had pitched for it. And they offered holocausts and peace offerings before God. Chronicles : And when David had completed offering holocausts and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord. Chronicles : And he divided to every single one, from men even to women, a twist of bread, and a piece of roasted beef, and fine wheat flour fried with oil. Chronicles : And he appointed some from the Levites who would minister before the ark of the Lord, and commemorate his works, and glorify and praise the Lord, the God of Israel. Chronicles : Asaph was the leader, and second to him was Zechariah. In addition, there were Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obededom. And Jeiel was over the instruments of the psaltery and the harps. But Asaph sounded out with the cymbals. Chronicles : Truly, the priests, Benaiah and Jahaziel, were to sound the trumpet continually before the ark of the covenant of the Lord. Chronicles : In that day, David made Asaph the leader, in order to confess to the Lord with his brothers: Chronicles : Confess to the Lord, and invoke his name. Make known his endeavors among the peoples. Chronicles : Sing to him, and sing psalms to him, and describe all his miracles. Chronicles : Praise his holy name! Let the heart of those who seek the Lord rejoice! Chronicles : Seek the Lord and his virtue. Seek his face always. Chronicles : Remember his miracles, which he has accomplished, his signs, and the judgments of his mouth. Chronicles : O offspring of Israel, his servants! O sons of Jacob, his elect! Chronicles : He is the Lord our God. His judgments are throughout all the earth. Chronicles : Remember forever his covenant, the word that he instructed unto a thousand generations, Chronicles : the covenant that he formed with Abraham, and his oath with Isaac. Chronicles : And he appointed the same to Jacob as a precept, and to Israel as an everlasting pact, Chronicles : saying: To you, I will give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance. Chronicles : At that time, they were small in number, they were few and were settlers there. Chronicles : And they passed through, from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people. Chronicles : He did not permit anyone to falsely accuse them. Instead, he reproved kings on their behalf: Chronicles : Do not touch my Christ. And do not malign my prophets. Chronicles : Sing to the Lord, all the earth! Announce his salvation, from day to day. Chronicles : Describe his glory among the Gentiles, his miracles among all the peoples. Chronicles : For the Lord is great and exceedingly praiseworthy. And he is terrible, above all gods. Chronicles : For all the gods of the peoples are idols. But the Lord made the heavens. Chronicles : Confession and magnificence are before him. Strength and gladness are in his place. Chronicles : Bring to the Lord, O families of the peoples, bring to the Lord glory and dominion. Chronicles : Give glory to the Lord, to his name. Lift up sacrifice, and approach before his sight. And adore the Lord in holy attire. Chronicles : Let all the earth be moved before his face. For he founded the globe immoveable. Chronicles : Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth exult. And let them say among the nations, The Lord has reigned. Chronicles : Let the sea roar, with all its plenitude. Let the fields exult, with all that is in them. Chronicles : Then the trees of the forest will give praise before the Lord. For he comes to judge the earth. Chronicles : Confess to the Lord, for he is good. For his mercy is eternal. Chronicles : And say: Save us, O God our savior! And gather us together, and rescue us from the nations, so that we may confess to your holy name, and may exult in your songs. Chronicles : Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, from eternity to eternity. And let all the people say, Amen, and let them sing a hymn to the Lord. Chronicles : And so, there before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, he left Asaph and his brothers, so that they might minister in the sight of the ark continually, throughout each day, and in their turns. Chronicles : Now Obededom and his brothers were sixty-eight. And he appointed Obededom, the son of Jeduthun, and Hosah to be porters. Chronicles : But Zadok the priest, and his brothers the priests, were before the tabernacle of the Lord in the high place, which was in Gibeon, Chronicles : so that they could offer holocausts to the Lord upon the altar of holocausts continually, morning and evening, according to all that was written in the law of the Lord, which he instructed to Israel. Chronicles : And after him, Heman, and Jeduthun, and the remainder of the elect, each one by his name, were appointed to confess to the Lord: For his mercy endures forever. Chronicles : Also Heman and Jeduthun sounded the trumpet, and they played upon the cymbals, and upon every kind of musical instrument, in order to sing praises to God. But the sons of Jeduthun he made to be porters. Chronicles : And all the people returned to their houses, and David also, so that he might bless his own house too. Chronicles : Now when David was living in his house, he said to the prophet Nathan: Behold, I live in a house of cedar. But the ark of the covenant of the Lord is under tent skins. Chronicles : And Nathan said to David: Do all that is in your heart. For God is with you. Chronicles : And yet, that night the word of God came to Nathan, saying: Chronicles : Go, and speak to my servant David: Thus says the Lord: You shall not build a house for me as a dwelling place. Chronicles : For I have not stayed in a house from the time when I led out Israel, even to this day. Instead, I have been continually changing places, in a tabernacle and tent, Chronicles : dwelling with all of Israel. When did I ever speak to any one at all, among the judges of Israel whom I placed in charge so that they might pasture my people, saying: Why have you not built a house of cedar for me? Chronicles : And so, now you shall say this to my servant David: Thus says the Lord of hosts: I took you when you were following the flock in the pastures, so that you would be the leader of my people Israel. Chronicles : And I have been with you wherever you have gone. And I have slain all your enemies before you, and I have made a name for you like one of the great ones who are celebrated upon the earth. Chronicles : And I have given a place to my people Israel. They shall be planted, and they shall live in it, and they shall no longer be moved. Neither shall the sons of iniquity wear them away, as in the beginning, Chronicles : from the days when I gave judges to my people Israel, and I humbled all your enemies. Therefore, I announce to you that the Lord will build a house for you. Chronicles : And when you will have completed your days, so that you go to your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall be from your sons. And I will establish his kingdom. Chronicles : He shall build a house for me, and I will make firm his throne, even unto eternity. Chronicles : I will be a father to him, and he shall be a son to me. And I will not take away my mercy from him, as I took it away from the one who was before you. Chronicles : And I will station him in my house and in my kingdom, even forever. And his throne will be very firm, in perpetuity. Chronicles : According to all these words, and according to this entire vision, so did Nathan speak to David. Chronicles : And when king David had departed, and had sat down before the Lord, he said: Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my house, that you would grant such things to me? Chronicles : But even this has seemed little in your sight, and therefore you have also spoken about the house of your servant even for the future. And you have made me a spectacle above all men, O Lord God. Chronicles : What more can David add, since you have so glorified your servant, and have known him? Chronicles : O Lord, because of your servant, in accord with your own heart, you have brought about all this magnificence, and you have willed all these great things to be known. Chronicles : O Lord, there is no one like you. And there is no other God apart from you, out of all whom we have heard about with our ears. Chronicles : For what other single nation upon earth is like your people Israel, to whom God reached out, so that he might free them, and might make a people for himself, and by his greatness and terribleness cast out the nations before the face of those whom he had freed from Egypt? Chronicles : And you have set your people Israel to be your people, even unto eternity. And you, O Lord, have become their God. Chronicles : Now therefore, O Lord, let the word that you have spoken to your servant, and over his house, be confirmed in perpetuity, and do just as you have spoken. Chronicles : And may your name remain and be magnified even for all time. And let it be said: The Lord of hosts is the God of Israel. And the house of his servant David remains forever before him. Chronicles : For you, O Lord my God, have revealed to the ear of your servant that you will build a house for him. And therefore your servant has found faith so that he might pray before you. Chronicles : Now then, O Lord, you are God. And you have spoken to your servant such great benefits. Chronicles : And you have begun to bless the house of your servant, so that it may be always before you. For since it is you who is blessing, O Lord, it shall be blessed forever. Chronicles : Now after these things, it happened that David struck the Philistines, and he humbled them, and he took Gath and her daughters from the hand of the Philistines. Chronicles : And he struck Moab. And the Moabites became the servants of David, offering gifts to him. Chronicles : In that time, David also struck Hadadezer, the king of Zobah, in the region of Hamath, when he went forth so that he might extend his dominion as far as the river Euphrates. Chronicles : Then David seized one thousand of his four-horse chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand men on foot. And he hamstrung all the chariot horses, except for one hundred four-horse chariots, which he reserved for himself. Chronicles : Then the Syrians of Damascus also arrived, so that they might offer assistance to Hadadezer, the king of Zobah. And so, David then struck of them twenty-two thousand men. Chronicles : And he stationed soldiers in Damascus, so that Syria also would serve him, and would offer gifts. And the Lord assisted him in all the things to which he went forth. Chronicles : Also, David took the golden quivers, which the servants of Hadadezer had, and he brought them to Jerusalem. Chronicles : In addition, from Tibhath and Cun, cities of Hadadezer, he brought very much brass, from which Solomon made the sea of brass, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass. Chronicles : Now when Toi, the king of Hamath, had heard this, specifically that David had struck the entire army of Hadadezer, the king of Zobah, Chronicles : he sent his son Hadoram to king David so that he might petition peace from him, and so that he might congratulate him that he had struck and defeated Hadadezer. For indeed, Toi was an adversary to Hadadezer. Chronicles : Moreover, all the vessels of gold and silver and brass king David consecrated to the Lord, with the silver and gold that he had taken from all the nations, as much from Idumea, and Moab, and the sons of Ammon, as from the Philistines and Amalek. Chronicles : Truly, Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, struck eighteen thousand of the Edomites in the Valley of the Salt Pits. Chronicles : And he stationed a garrison in Edom, so that Idumea would serve David. And the Lord saved David in all the things to which he went forth. Chronicles : Therefore, David reigned over all of Israel, and he executed judgment and justice among all his people. Chronicles : Now Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was over the army, and Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, was the keeper of records. Chronicles : And Zadok, the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech, the son of Abiathar, were the priests. And Shavsha was the scribe. Chronicles : Also, Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, was over the legions of the Cherethites and Pelethites. But the sons of David were first at the hand of the king. Chronicles : Now it happened that Nahash, the king of the sons of Ammon, died, and his son reigned in his place. Chronicles : And David said: I will act with mercy toward Hanun, the son of Nahash. For his father was gracious to me. And so David sent messengers to console him over the death of his father. But when they had reached the land of the sons of Ammon, so that they might console Hanun, Chronicles : the leaders of the sons of Ammon said to Hanun: Do you think that perhaps David has sent them to console you in order to honor your father? Have you not noticed that his servants came to you so that they might explore, and investigate, and examine your land? Chronicles : And so Hanun shaved the heads and beards of the servants of David, and he cut away their tunics from the buttocks to the feet, and he sent them away. Chronicles : And when they had gone, and had sent word to David, for they had suffered a great disgrace, he sent to meet them, and he instructed them that they should remain at Jericho until their beards grew, and then they should return. Chronicles : Then, when the sons of Ammon realized that they had committed an injury against David, both Hanun and the rest of the people sent one thousand talents of silver, so that they might hire for themselves chariots and horsemen from Mesopotamia, and from Syrian Maacah, and from Zobah. Chronicles : And they hired thirty-two thousand chariots, and the king of Maacah with his people. When these had arrived, they made camp in the region opposite Medeba. Also, the sons of Ammon, gathering from their cities, went to war. Chronicles : And when David had heard this, he sent Joab and the entire army of strong men. Chronicles : And the sons of Ammon, going out, set up a battle line before the gate of the city. But the kings who had come to their aid stood separately in the field. Chronicles : And so Joab, understanding the war to be set facing him and behind his back, chose the strongest men from all of Israel, and he went out against the Syrians. Chronicles : But the remaining portion of the people he placed under the hand of his brother Abishai. And they went out against the sons of Ammon. Chronicles : And he said: If the Syrians prevail over me, then you shall be a help to me. But if the sons of Ammon prevail over you, I will be a safeguard for you. Chronicles : Be strengthened, and let us act manfully on behalf of our people, and on behalf of the cities of our God. And the Lord will do what is good in his own sight. Chronicles : Therefore, Joab, and the people who were with him, went out to battle against the Syrians. And he put them to flight. Chronicles : Then the sons of Ammon, seeing that the Syrians had fled, also themselves fled from Abishai, his brother, and they entered into the city. And now Joab returned to Jerusalem. Chronicles : But the Syrians, seeing that they had fallen before Israel, sent messengers, and they brought the Syrians who were across the river. And Shophach, the leader of the military of Hadadezer, was their commander. Chronicles : When this had been reported to David, he gathered together all of Israel, and he crossed the Jordan. And he rushed toward them. And he set up a battle line facing them. And they fought against him. Chronicles : But the Syrians fled from Israel. And David killed of the Syrians seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand men on foot, and Shophach, the leader of the army. Chronicles : Then the servants of Hadadezer, seeing themselves to be overwhelmed by Israel, crossed over to David, and they served him. And Syria was no longer willing to offer aid to the sons of Ammon. Chronicles : Now it happened that, after the course of a year, in the time when kings usually go forth to war, Joab gathered an army with experienced soldiers, and he laid waste to the land of the sons of Ammon. And he continued on and besieged Rabbah. But David was staying in Jerusalem when Joab struck Rabbah and destroyed it. Chronicles : Then David took the crown of Milcom from his head, and he found in it the weight of one talent of gold, and very precious gems. And he made for himself a diadem from it. Also, he took the best spoils of the city, which were very many. Chronicles : Then he led away the people who were in it. And he caused plows, and sleds, and iron chariots to go over them, so much so that they were cut apart and crushed. So did David treat all the cities of the sons of Ammon. And he returned with all his people to Jerusalem. Chronicles : After these things, a war was begun at Gezer against the Philistines, in which Sibbecai the Hushathite struck Sippai from the race of the Rephaim, and he humbled them. Chronicles : Also, another war was undertaken against the Philistines, in which Adeodatus, a son of the forest, a Bethlehemite, struck the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the wood of whose spear was like a weavers beam. Chronicles : Then too, another war occurred in Gath, in which there was a very tall man, having six digits, that is, all together twenty-four. This man too was born from the stock of the Rephaim. Chronicles : He blasphemed Israel. And Jonathan, the son of Shimea, the brother of David, struck him down. Chronicles : These were the sons of the Rephaim in Gath, who fell by the hand of David and his servants. Chronicles : Now Satan rose up against Israel, and he incited David so that he would number Israel. Chronicles : And David said to Joab and to the leaders of the people: Go, and number Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan. And bring me the number, so that I may know it. Chronicles : And Joab responded: May the Lord increase his people a hundred times more than they are. But, my lord the king, are they not all your servants? Why would my lord seek this thing, which may be imputed as a sin to Israel? Chronicles : But the word of the king prevailed instead. And Joab went away, and he traveled around, through all of Israel. And he returned to Jerusalem. Chronicles : And he gave to David the number of those whom he had surveyed. And the entire number of Israel was found to be one million and one hundred thousand men who could draw the sword; but from Judah, there were four hundred and seventy thousand men of war. Chronicles : But Levi and Benjamin he did not number. For Joab executed the orders of the king unwillingly. Chronicles : Then God was displeased with what had been ordered, and so he struck Israel. Chronicles : And David said to God: I have sinned exceedingly in doing this. I beg you take away the iniquity of your servant. For I have acted unwisely. Chronicles : And the Lord spoke to Gad, the seer of David, saying: Chronicles : Go, and speak to David, and tell him: Thus says the Lord: I give to you the option of three things. Choose the one that you will want, and I will do it to you. Chronicles : And when Gad had gone to David, he said to him: Thus says the Lord: Choose what you will want: Chronicles : Either three years of famine, or three months for you to flee from your enemies, unable to escape from their sword, or three days for the sword of the Lord and a pestilence to turn within the land, with the Angel of the Lord killing in every part of Israel. Now therefore, see what I should respond to him who sent me. Chronicles : And David said to Gad: There are difficulties pressing upon me from every side. But it is better for me to fall into the hands of the Lord, for his mercies are many, than into the hands of men. Chronicles : Therefore, the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel. And there fell from Israel seventy thousand men. Chronicles : Also, he sent an Angel to Jerusalem, so that he might strike it. And while he was striking, the Lord saw and took pity over the magnitude of the harm. And he commanded the Angel who was striking: It is enough. Now let your hand cease. And the Angel of the Lord was standing beside the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. Chronicles : And David, lifting up his eyes, saw the Angel of the Lord, standing between heaven and earth with a drawn sword in his hand, turned toward Jerusalem. And both he and those greater by birth, being clothed in haircloth, fell prone upon the ground. Chronicles : And David said to God: Am I not the one who ordered that the people be numbered? It is I who sinned; it is I who did evil. This flock, what does it deserve? O Lord my God, I beg you to let your hand be turned against me and against the house of my father. But let not your people be struck down. Chronicles : Then the Angel of the Lord instructed Gad to tell David that he should ascend and build an altar to the Lord God on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. Chronicles : Therefore, David ascended, in accord with the word of Gad, which he had spoken to him in the name of the Lord. Chronicles : Now when Ornan had looked up and seen the Angel, he and his four sons hid themselves. For at that time, he was threshing wheat upon the floor. Chronicles : Then, as David was approaching Ornan, Ornan saw him, and he went out from the threshing floor to meet him. And he reverenced him prone on the ground. Chronicles : And David said to him: Give this place of your threshing floor to me, so that I may build an altar to the Lord upon it. And you shall accept from me as much money as it is worth, so that the plague may cease from the people. Chronicles : But Ornan said to David: Take it, and may my lord the king do whatever pleases him. Moreover, I give the oxen also as a holocaust, and the plow for wood, and the wheat for a sacrifice. I will offer all freely. Chronicles : And king David said to him: By no means shall it be so. Instead, I will give money to you, as much as it is worth. For I must not take it from you, and thereby offer to the Lord holocausts that cost nothing. Chronicles : Therefore, David gave Ornan, for the place, the very just weight of six hundred shekels of gold. Chronicles : And he built an altar to the Lord there. And he offered holocausts and peace offerings, and he called upon the Lord. And he heeded him by sending fire from heaven upon the altar of the holocaust. Chronicles : And the Lord instructed the Angel, and he turned his sword back into its sheath. Chronicles : Then, seeing that the Lord had heeded him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, David immediately immolated victims there. Chronicles : But the tabernacle of the Lord, which Moses had made in the desert, and the altar of holocausts, were at that time on the high place of Gibeon. Chronicles : And David was unable to go to the altar, so that he might pray to God there. For he had been struck with an exceedingly great fear, seeing the sword of the Angel of the Lord. Chronicles : And David said, This is the house of God, and this is the altar for the holocaust of Israel. Chronicles : And he instructed them to gather all the new converts from the land of Israel. And from these he appointed stoneworkers, to hew stones and to polish them, so that he might build the house of God. Chronicles : Also, David prepared very much iron to use for the nails of the gates, and for the seams and joints, as well as an immeasurable weight of brass. Chronicles : Also, the cedar trees, which the Sidonians and Tyrians had transported to David, were not able to be counted. Chronicles : And David said: My son Solomon is a young and tender boy. But the house that I desire to be built to the Lord ought to be so great that it is renowned in every region. Therefore, I will prepare what will be necessary for him. And for this reason, before his death, he prepared all the expenses. Chronicles : And he called for Solomon, his son. And he instructed him to build a house to the Lord, the God of Israel. Chronicles : And David said to Solomon: My son, it was my will that I build a house to the name of the Lord my God. Chronicles : But the word of the Lord came to me, saying: You have shed much blood, and you have battled in many wars. You are not able to build a house to my name, so great was the shedding of blood before me. Chronicles : The son who shall be born to you will be a very quiet man. For I will cause him to have rest from all his enemies on every side. And for this reason, he shall be called Peaceful. And I will grant peace and tranquility to Israel during all his days. Chronicles : He shall build a house to my name. And he shall be a son to me, and I will be a father to him. And I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel unto eternity. Chronicles : Now then, my son, may the Lord be with you, and may you prosper and build a house to the Lord your God, just as he has spoken concerning you. Chronicles : Also, may the Lord give you prudence and understanding, so that you may be able to rule Israel and to guard the law of the Lord your God. Chronicles : For then you will be able to advance, if you keep the commandments and judgments that the Lord instructed Moses to teach to Israel. Be strengthened and act manfully. You should not fear, and you should not dread. Chronicles : Behold, in my poverty I have prepared the expenses for the house of the Lord: one hundred thousand talents of gold, and one million of talents of silver. Yet truly, there is no measuring the brass and the iron. For their magnitude is beyond numbering. And I have prepared the timber and the stones for the entire project. Chronicles : Also, you have very many artisans: stoneworkers, and builders of walls, and craftsmen of wood, and those most prudent in doing the work of every art, Chronicles : with gold and silver, and with brass and iron, of which there is no number. Therefore, rise up and act. And the Lord will be with you. Chronicles : Also, David instructed all the leaders of Israel, so that they would assist his son Solomon, Chronicles : saying: You discern that the Lord your God is with you, and that he has given you rest on all sides, and that he has delivered all your enemies into your hands, and that the land has been subdued before the Lord and before his people. Chronicles : Therefore, offer your hearts and your souls, so that you seek the Lord your God. And rise up and build a sanctuary to the Lord God, so that the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and the vessels consecrated to the Lord, may be brought into the house that is built to the name of the Lord. Chronicles : Then David, being old and full of days, appointed his son Solomon as king over Israel. Chronicles : And he gathered together all the leaders of Israel, with the priests as well as the Levites. Chronicles : And the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward. And there were found thirty-eight thousand men. Chronicles : Of these, twenty-four thousand were chosen and distributed to the ministry of the house of the Lord. Then six thousand were overseers and judges. Chronicles : Moreover, four thousand were porters. And the same number were the singers of psalms to the Lord, with the musical instruments which he had made for the music. Chronicles : And David distributed them into courses according to the sons of Levi, specifically, Gershom, and Kohath, and Merari. Chronicles : The sons of Gershom: Ladan and Shimei. Chronicles : The sons of Ladan: the leader Jahiel, and Zetham, and Joel, three. Chronicles : The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the leaders of the families of Ladan. Chronicles : Then the sons of Shimei: Jahath, and Zizah, and Jeush, and Beriah. These were the sons of Shimei, four. Chronicles : Now Jahath was first, Zizah second, but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons, and for this reason they were reckoned as one family and one house. Chronicles : The sons of Kohath: Amram and Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel, four. Chronicles : The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. Now Aaron was separated so that he might minister in the Holy of Holies, he and his sons forever, and so that he might burn incense to the Lord, according to his rite, and so that he might bless his name in perpetuity. Chronicles : The sons of Moses, the man of God, were also numbered in the tribe of Levi. Chronicles : The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer. Chronicles : The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the first. Chronicles : Now the sons of Eliezer were Rehabiah the first. And there were no other sons for Eliezer. But the sons of Rehabiah were multiplied exceedingly. Chronicles : The sons of Izhar: Shelomith the first. Chronicles : The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth. Chronicles : The sons of Uzziel: Micah the first, Isshiah the second. Chronicles : The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish. Chronicles : Then Eleazar died, and had no sons, but only daughters. And so the sons of Kish, their brothers, married them. Chronicles : The sons of Mushi: Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three. Chronicles : These are the sons of Levi, in their kindred and families, leaders in turns, and the number of each of the heads who were doing the works of the ministry of the house of the Lord, from twenty years of age and upward. Chronicles : For David said: The Lord, the God of Israel, has given rest to his people, and a habitation in Jerusalem even unto eternity. Chronicles : Neither shall it be the office of the Levites any more to carry the tabernacle with all its equipment for use in the ministry. Chronicles : Also, according to the last precepts of David, the sons of Levi shall be counted by number from twenty years of age and upward. Chronicles : And they shall be under the hand of the sons of Aaron, in the care of the house of the Lord, in the vestibule, and in the chambers, and in the place of purification, and in the sanctuary, and in all the works of the ministry of the temple of the Lord. Chronicles : But the priests shall be over the bread of the presence, and the sacrifice of fine wheat flour, and the unleavened cakes, and the frying pan, and the roasting, and over every weight and measure. Chronicles : Yet truly, the Levites shall stand to confess and to sing to the Lord, in the morning, and similarly in the evening, Chronicles : as much in the oblation of the holocausts of the Lord, as in the Sabbaths and new moons and other solemnities, according to the number and ceremonies for each and every matter, perpetually before the Lord. Chronicles : And let them keep the observances of the tabernacle of the covenant, and the rituals of the sanctuary, and the observance of the sons of Aaron, their brothers, so that they may minister in the house of the Lord. Chronicles : Now these were the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron: Nadab, and Abihu, and Eleazar, and Ithamar. Chronicles : But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and without children. And so Eleazar and Ithamar exercised the priestly office. Chronicles : And David distributed them, that is, Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their courses and ministry. Chronicles : And there were found many more of the sons of Eleazar among the leading men, than of the sons of Ithamar. Therefore, he divided them so that there were, of the sons of Eleazar, sixteen leaders by their families, and of the sons of Ithamar eight by their families and houses. Chronicles : Then he divided among them, in both families, by lot. For there were leaders of the sanctuary and leaders of God, as much from the sons of Eleazar as from the sons of Ithamar. Chronicles : And the scribe Shemaiah, the son of Nethanel, a Levite, wrote these down before the king and the leaders, with Zadok, the priest, and Ahimelech, the son of Abiathar, and also the leaders of the priestly and Levitical families. And there was one house, which was preeminent over the others, that of Eleazar; and there was another house, which had the others under it, that of Ithamar.

Chronicles : In addition, the son of Mahli was Eleazar, who had no children. Chronicles : Truly, the son of Kish was Jerahmeel. Chronicles : The sons of Mushi were Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of Levi according to the houses of their families. Chronicles : And they also cast lots concerning their brothers, the sons of Aaron, before David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the leaders of the priestly and Levitical families, as much concerning the elder as the younger. The lot divided all things equitably. Chronicles : Then David and the magistrates of the army set apart, for the ministry, the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who were to prophesy with harps and psalteries and cymbals, in accord with their number, having been dedicated to their appointed office.

Chronicles : All these, under their fathers hand, were distributed in order to sing in the temple of the Lord, with cymbals and psalteries and harps, in the ministry of the house of the Lord beside the king, specifically, Asaph, and Jeduthun, and Heman. Chronicles : Now the number of these, with their brothers, who were instructing in the song of the Lord, all the teachers, were two hundred eighty-eight.

Chronicles : Now the divisions of the porters were, from the Korahites: Meshelemiah, the son of Kore, of the sons of Asaph. Chronicles : The sons of Meshelemiah: Zechariah the firstborn, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth, Chronicles : Elam the fifth, Jehohanan the sixth, Eliehoenai the seventh. Chronicles : Then the sons of Obededom: Shemaiah the firstborn, Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, Sachar the fourth, Nethanel the fifth, Chronicles : Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, Peullethai the eighth. For the Lord had blessed him. Chronicles : Now to his son Shemaiah, there were born sons, rulers of their families. For they were very strong men. Chronicles : Then the sons of Shemaiah were Othni, and Rephael, and Obed, Elzabad and his brothers, very strong men, as well as Elihu and Semachiah. Chronicles : All these were from the sons of Obededom: they and their sons and brothers, very fit for the ministry, sixty-two from Obededom. Chronicles : Then there were the sons of Meshelemiah and their brothers, very robust men, eighteen. Chronicles : Now, from Hosah, that is, from the sons of Merari: Shimri the leader, for he had not had a firstborn son, and so, because of this, his father had appointed him as the leader, Chronicles : Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, Zechariah the fourth. All these, the sons and brothers of Hosah, were thirteen. Chronicles : These were distributed as porters, so that the leaders of the posts, as well as their brothers, were ministering continually in the house of the Lord. Chronicles : Then they cast lots equally, for both the small and the great, by their families, concerning each one of the gates. Chronicles : And the lot of the east fell out to Shelemiah. But to his son Zechariah, a very prudent and learned man, the northern section was obtained by lot. Chronicles : Truly, Obededom and his sons obtained that to the south, in the part of the house where the council of elders was. Chronicles : Shuppim and Hosah obtained that toward the west, beside the gate that leads to the way of the ascent, one post facing the other. Chronicles : Truly, toward the east there were six Levites, and toward the north there were four per day, and then toward the south similarly there were four each day. And where the council was, there were two and two. Chronicles : Also, in the cells of the porters toward the west, there were four along the way, and two at every cell. Chronicles : These are the divisions of the porters of the sons of Kohath and of Merari. Chronicles : Now Ahijah was over the treasuries of the house of God, and the holy vessels. Chronicles : The sons of Ladan, sons of Gershon: from Ladan, leaders of the families of Ladan and of Gershon: Jehieli. Chronicles : The sons of Jehieli: Zetham and Joel; his brothers were over the treasuries of the house of the Lord, Chronicles : with the Amramites, and Izharites, and Hebronites, and Uzzielites. Chronicles : Now, Shebuel, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, was in the first place over the treasuries, Chronicles : along with his brothers, Eliezer, and his son Rehabiah, and his son Jeshaiah, and his son Joram, and also his son Zichri, and his son Shelomoth. Chronicles : The same Shelomoth and his brothers were over the treasuries of the holy things, which king David sanctified, with the leaders of the families, and the tribunes, and the centurions, and the commanders of the army. Chronicles : These things were from the wars and from the best spoils of the battles, which they had consecrated for the repair and the furnishing of the temple of the Lord. Chronicles : Now all these things were sanctified by Samuel, the seer, and by Saul, the son of Kish, and by Abner, the son of Ner, and by Joab, the son of Zeruiah. All those who had sanctified these were under the hand of Shelomoth and his brothers. Chronicles : Yet truly, Chenaniah and his sons were over the Izharites, for the exterior works concerning Israel, in order to teach and to judge them. Chronicles : Now from the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brothers, one thousand seven hundred very strong men, were in charge of Israel across the Jordan toward the west, in all the works of the Lord, and in the ministry of the king. Chronicles : And the leader of the Hebronites was Jerijah, according to their families and kindred. In the fortieth year of the reign of David, they were numbered, and there were found very strong men in Jazer Gilead. Chronicles : And his brothers of a mature age were two thousand seven hundred leaders of families. Then king David placed them in charge of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the one half tribe of Manasseh, in all of the ministries of God and of the king. Chronicles : Now the sons of Israel, according to their number, the leaders of the families, the tribunes, and the centurions, and the chiefs, who were ministering to the king by their companies, entering and departing in each month of the year as they were in charge, were twenty-four thousand. Chronicles : Jashobeam, the son of Zabdiel, was in charge of the first company in the first month; and under him were twenty-four thousand. Chronicles : He was from the sons of Perez, and he was the leader of all the other leaders in the army, in the first month. Chronicles : The company of the second month had Dodai, an Ahohite; and after him there was another, named Mikloth, who ruled over a portion of the army of the twenty-four thousand. Chronicles : Also, the commander of the third company, in the third month, was Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada the priest; and in his division there were twenty-four thousand. Chronicles : The same is the Benaiah who was strongest among the thirty, and was above the thirty. But his son, Ammizabad, was in charge of his company. Chronicles : The fourth, for the fourth month, was Asahel, the brother of Joab, and his son Zebadiah after him; and in his company there were twenty-four thousand. Chronicles : The fifth leader, for the fifth month, was Shamhuth, an Izrahite; and in his company there were twenty-four thousand. Chronicles : The sixth, for the sixth month, was Ira, the son of Ikkesh, a Tekoite; and in his company there were twenty-four thousand. Chronicles : The seventh, for the seventh month, was Helez, a Pelonite from the sons of Ephraim; and in his company there were twenty-four thousand. Chronicles : The eighth, for the eighth month, was Sibbecai, a Hushathite from the stock of the Zerahites; and in his company there were twenty-four thousand. Chronicles : The ninth, for the ninth month, was Abiezer, an Anathothite from the sons of Benjamin; and in his company there were twenty-four thousand. Chronicles : The tenth, for the tenth month, was Maharai, and he was a Netophathite from the stock of the Zerahites; and in his company there were twenty-four thousand. Chronicles : The eleventh, for the eleventh month, was Benaiah, a Pirathonite from the sons of Ephraim; and in his company there were twenty-four thousand. Chronicles : The twelfth, for the twelfth month, was Heldai, a Netophathite from the stock of Othniel; and in his company there were twenty-four thousand. Chronicles : Now those who were first over the tribes of Israel were these: over the Reubenites, Eliezer, the son of Zichri, was the ruler; over the Simeonites, Shephatiah, the son of Maacah, was the ruler; Chronicles : over the Levites, Hashabiah, the son of Kemuel; over the Aaronites, Zadok; Chronicles : over Judah, Elihu, the brother of David; over Issachar, Omri, the son of Michael; Chronicles : over the Zebulunites, Ishmaiah, the son of Obadiah; over the Naphtalites, Jeremoth, the son of Azriel; Chronicles : over the sons of Ephraim, Hoshea, the son of Azaziah; over the one half tribe of Manasseh, Joel, the son of Pedaiah; Chronicles : and over the one half tribe of Manasseh in Gilead, Iddo, the son of Zechariah; then over Benjamin, Jaasiel, the son of Abner; Chronicles : yet truly, Azarel, the son of Jeroham, was over Dan. These were the leaders of the sons of Israel. Chronicles : But David was not willing to number them from twenty years old and under. For the Lord had said that he would multiply Israel like the stars of heaven. Chronicles : Joab, the son of Zeruiah, had begun to number, but he did not finish. For because of this, wrath had fallen upon Israel. And therefore the number of those who had been counted was not related in the official records of king David. Chronicles : Now over the storerooms of the king was Azmaveth, the son of Adiel. But Jonathan, the son of Uzziah, was over those storerooms that were in the cities, and in the villages, and in the towers. Chronicles : And over the farmlands and the farmers, those who worked the ground, was Ezri, the son of Chelub. Chronicles : And over the cultivators of vineyards was Shimei, a Ramathite; then over the wine cellars was Zabdi, an Aphonite. Chronicles : Now over the olive groves and the fig groves, which were in the plains, was Baal-hanan, a Gederite; and over the oil cellars was Joash. Chronicles : Now over the herds that were pastured in Sharon, Shitrai, a Sharonite, was in the first place; and over the oxen in the valleys, there was Shaphat, the son of Adlai. Chronicles : Truly, over the camels was Obil, an Ishmaelite; and over the donkeys was Jehdeiah, a Meronothite. Chronicles : And over the sheep was Jaziz, a Hagarene. All these were leaders over the substance of king David. Chronicles : Now Jonathan, the uncle of David, was a counselor, a prudent and scholarly man; he and Jehiel, the son of Hachmoni, were with the sons of the king. Chronicles : Now Ahithophel was the counselor of the king; and Hushai, the Archite, was the kings friend. Chronicles : After Ahithophel was Jehoiada, the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar. But the leader of the army of the king was Joab. Chronicles : And so David called together all the leaders of Israel, the rulers of the tribes, and those in charge of the companies, who were ministering to the king, and also the tribunes and centurions, and those in charge of the substance and possessions of the king, and his sons, with the eunuchs and the powerful and those most experienced in the army, at Jerusalem. Chronicles : And when the king had risen up and was standing, he said: Listen to me, my brothers and my people. I thought that I would build a house, in which the ark of the covenant of the Lord, the footstool of our God, might rest. And so I prepared everything for its building. Chronicles : But God said to me: You shall not build a house to my name, because you are a man of war, and have shed blood. Chronicles : Now the Lord God of Israel chose me, out of the entire house of my father, so that I would be king over Israel forever. For from Judah he chose leaders; then from the house of Judah he chose the house of my father; and from the sons of my father, it pleased him to choose me as king over all of Israel. Chronicles : Then too, among my sons for the Lord has given me many sons he chose Solomon my son, so that he would sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the Lord, over Israel. Chronicles : And he said to me: Solomon your son shall build my house and my courts. For I have chosen him to be to me as a son, and I will be to him as a father. Chronicles : And I will make firm his kingdom, even unto eternity, if he will persevere in doing my precepts and judgments, as also today. Chronicles : Now therefore, before the entire assembly of Israel, in the hearing of our God, keep and seek all the commandments of the Lord our God, so that you may possess the good land, and may bequeath it to your sons after you, even forever. Chronicles : And as for you, my son Solomon, know the God of your father, and serve him with a perfect heart and a willing mind. For the Lord searches all hearts, and understands the thoughts of all minds. If you seek him, you will find him. But if you abandon him, he will cast you aside for eternity. Chronicles : Now therefore, since the Lord has chosen you, so that you would build the house of the Sanctuary, be strengthened and accomplish it. Chronicles : Then David gave to his son Solomon a description of the portico, and the temple, and the storerooms, and the upper floor, and the innermost rooms, and the house of propitiation, Chronicles : and indeed also of all the courts that he had planned, and the outer rooms on all sides, for the treasuries of the house of the Lord, and for the treasuries of the holy things, Chronicles : and for the divisions of the priests and the Levites: concerning all the works of the house of the Lord and all the items in the ministry of the temple of the Lord. Chronicles : There was gold by weight for every vessel of the ministry, and also silver by weight for the diversity of vessels and equipment. Chronicles : Then too, he distributed gold for the lampstands and their lamps, according to the measure of each of the lampstands with their lamps. Similarly also, he distributed silver by weight for the silver lampstands with their lamps, according to the diversity of their measure. Chronicles : Also, he gave gold for the tables of the presence, according to the diversity of the tables; similarly too, he gave silver for the other tables of silver. Chronicles : Also, he distributed from the purest gold for the small hooks and the bowls and the censors, as well as for the little lions of gold, in accord with the precise measure of the weight, for lion after lion. Similarly too, for the lions of silver, he set aside a different weight of silver. Chronicles : Then, for the altar on which the incense was burned, he gave the purest gold. And from the same he made the likeness of the chariot of the Cherubim, with extended wings, which is veiling the ark of the covenant of the Lord. Chronicles : All these things, he said, came to me written by the hand of the Lord, so that I would understand all the works of the pattern. Chronicles : David also said to his son Solomon: Act manfully, and be strengthened, and carry it out. You should not be afraid, and you should not be dismayed. For the Lord my God will be with you, and he will not send you away, nor will he abandon you, until you have perfected the entire work of the ministry of the house of the Lord. Chronicles : Behold, the divisions of the priests and the Levites, for every ministry of the house of the Lord, are standing before you. And they have been prepared, and so they know, both the leaders and the people, how to carry out all your precepts. Chronicles : And king David spoke to the entire assembly: My son Solomon, the one God has chosen, is still a tender boy. And yet the work is great, for a habitation is being prepared, not for man, but for God. Chronicles : Now with all my ability, I have prepared the expenses for the house of my God: gold for items of gold, and silver for those of silver, brass for those of brass, iron for those of iron, and wood for those of wood, and stones of onyx, and stones like alabaster, and stones of diverse colors, and every kind of precious stone, and marble from Paros in great abundance. Chronicles : And in addition to these things that I have offered into the house of my God, I give, from my own belongings, gold and silver for the temple of my God, aside from those things that I have prepared for the holy shrine: Chronicles : three thousand talents of gold, from the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of highly-refined silver, for the gilding of the walls of the temple; Chronicles : and gold for wherever there is need of gold, and silver for wherever there is need of silver, for the works to be done by the hands of the artisans. And if anyone freely offers, let him fill his hand this day, and let him offer whatever he wishes to the Lord. Chronicles : And so the leaders of the families, and the nobles of the tribes of Israel, as well as the tribunes and the centurions and the overseers of the kings possessions, promised Chronicles : and gave, for the works of the house of the Lord, five thousand talents and ten thousand pieces of gold, ten thousand talents of silver, and eighteen thousand talents of brass, and also one hundred thousand talents of iron. Chronicles : And whoever found precious stones among their belongings gave them to the treasuries of the house of the Lord, by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite. Chronicles : And the people rejoiced, since they were promising their votive offerings willingly. For they were offering these to the Lord with all their heart. And king David also rejoiced with great gladness. Chronicles : And he blessed the Lord before the entire multitude, and he said: Blessed are you, O Lord God of Israel, our Father from eternity to eternity. Chronicles : Yours, O Lord, is magnificence and power and glory, and also victory; and to you is praise. For all the things that are in heaven and on earth are yours. Yours is the kingdom, O Lord, and you are above all rulers. Chronicles : Yours is wealth, and yours is glory. You have dominion over all things. In your hand is virtue and power. In your hand is greatness and authority over all things. Chronicles : Now therefore, we confess to you, our God, and we praise your famous name. Chronicles : Who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to promise all these things to you? All is yours. And so the things that we received from your hand, we have given to you. Chronicles : For we are sojourners and new arrivals before you, as all our fathers were. Our days upon the earth are like a shadow, and there is no delay. Chronicles : O Lord our God, all this abundance, which we have prepared so that a house may be built to your holy name, is from your hand, and all things are yours. Chronicles : I know, my God, that you test hearts, and that you love simplicity. Therefore, in the simplicity of my heart, I also have offered all these things joyfully. And I have seen, with immense gladness, your people, who have been found here, offering their donations to you. Chronicles : O Lord, the God of our fathers Abraham and Isaac and Israel, preserve unto eternity this desire of their heart, and let this purpose remain forever, for the worship of you. Chronicles : Also, I give to my son Solomon a perfect heart, so that he may keep your commandments, your testimonies, and your ceremonies, and so that he may accomplish all things, and may build the temple, for which I have prepared the expenses. Chronicles : Then David instructed the entire assembly: Bless the Lord our God. And the entire assembly blessed the Lord, the God of their fathers. And they bowed themselves, and they adored God, and next they reverenced the king. Chronicles : And they immolated victims to the Lord. And they offered holocausts on the following day: one thousand bulls, one thousand rams, one thousand lambs, with their libations and with every ritual, very abundantly, for all of Israel. Chronicles : And they ate and drank before the Lord on that day, with great rejoicing. And they anointed Solomon, the son of David, a second time. And they anointed him to the Lord as the ruler, and Zadok as the high priest. Chronicles : And Solomon sat upon the throne of the Lord as king, in place of his father David, and it pleased everyone. And all of Israel obeyed him. Chronicles : Moreover, all the leaders, and the powerful, and all the sons of king David pledged with their hand, and they became subject to king Solomon. Chronicles : Then the Lord magnified Solomon over all of Israel. And he gave to him a glorious reign, of a kind such as no one has had before him, as king of Israel. Chronicles : Now David, the son of Jesse, reigned over all of Israel. Chronicles : And the days during which he reigned over Israel were forty years. He reigned seven years in Hebron, and thirty-three years in Jerusalem. Chronicles : And he died at a good old age, full of days and wealth and glory. And his son Solomon reigned in his place. Chronicles : Now the acts of king David, from the first to the last, have been written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer, Chronicles : concerning his entire reign and strength, and the times that passed under him, both in Israel and in all the kingdoms of the lands. Chronicles : Then Solomon, the son of David, was strengthened in his reign, and the Lord his God was with him, and he magnified him on high. Chronicles : And Solomon instructed the whole of Israel, the tribunes, and the centurions, and the rulers, and the judges over all of Israel, and the leaders of the families. Chronicles : And he went away with the entire multitude to the high place of Gibeon, where the tabernacle of the covenant of the Lord was, which Moses, the servant of God, made in the wilderness. Chronicles : For David had brought the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim, to the place that he had prepared for it, and where he had pitched a tabernacle for it, that is, in Jerusalem. Chronicles : Also, the altar of brass, which Bezalel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had constructed, was there before the tabernacle of the Lord. And so Solomon sought it, with the entire assembly. Chronicles : And Solomon ascended to the bronze altar, before the tabernacle of the covenant of the Lord, and he offered upon it one thousand victims. Chronicles : But behold, during that night God appeared to him, saying, Request what you wish, so that I may give it to you. Chronicles : And Solomon said to God: You have shown great mercy to my father David. And you have appointed me as king in his place. Chronicles : Now therefore, O Lord God, let your word be fulfilled, which you promised to my father David. For you have made me king over your great people, who are as innumerable as the dust of the earth. Chronicles : Give to me wisdom and understanding, so that I may enter and depart before your people. For who is able worthily to judge this, your people, who are so great? Chronicles : Then God said to Solomon: Since this is the choice that pleased your heart, and you did not request wealth and substance and glory, nor the lives of those who hate you, nor even many days of life, since instead you requested wisdom and knowledge so that you may be able to judge my people, over whom I have appointed you as king: Chronicles : wisdom and knowledge are granted to you. And I will give to you wealth and substance and glory, so that none of the kings either before you or after you will be similar to you. Chronicles : Then Solomon went from the high place of Gibeon to Jerusalem, before the tabernacle of the covenant, and he reigned over Israel. Chronicles : And he gathered to himself chariots and horsemen. And they brought to him one thousand four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. And he caused them to be in the cities of the chariots, and with the king in Jerusalem. Chronicles : And the king offered silver and gold in Jerusalem as if they were stones, and cedar trees as if they were sycamores, which grow in the plains in a great multitude. Chronicles : Then horses were brought to him from Egypt and from Kue, by the negotiators of the king, who went and bought for a price: Chronicles : a four-horse chariot for six hundred pieces of silver, and a horse for one hundred fifty. A similar offer to purchase was made known among all the kingdoms of the Hittites, and among the kings of Syria. Chronicles : And Solomon resolved to build a house to the name of the Lord, and a palace for himself. Chronicles : And he numbered seventy thousand men to carry upon shoulders, and eighty thousand who were hewing stones in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred as their overseers. Chronicles : Also, he sent to Hiram, the king of Tyre, saying: Just as you did for my father David, when you sent him cedar wood, so that he might build a house for himself, in which he then lived, Chronicles : do so also for me, so that I may build a house to the name of the Lord my God, so that I may consecrate it for the burning of incense before him, and for the smoke of aromatics, and for the perpetual bread of the presence, and for the holocausts, in morning and in evening, as well as on the Sabbaths and new moons and solemnities of the Lord our God forever, which have been commanded to Israel. Chronicles : For the house that I desire to build is great. For our God is great, above all gods. Chronicles : So then, who will be able prevail, so that he may build a worthy house for him? If heaven and the heavens of heavens cannot contain him, what am I that I would be able to build a house to him? But let it be for this only, so that incense may be burned before him. Chronicles : Therefore, send to me a learned man, who knows how to work with gold and silver, with brass and iron, with purple, scarlet, and hyacinth, and who knows how to carve engravings, along with these artisans that I have with me in Judea and Jerusalem, whom my father David has prepared. Chronicles : Then too, send to me cedar wood, and juniper, and pine from Lebanon. For I know that your servants know how to cut timber from Lebanon, and my servants will be with your servants, Chronicles : so that very much wood may be prepared for me. For the house that I desire to build is exceedingly great and glorious. Chronicles : In addition, I will give to your servants, the workers who will cut down the trees, for provisions: twenty thousand cor of wheat, and the same number of cor of barley, and twenty thousand measures of wine, as well as twenty thousand good measures of oil. Chronicles : Then Hiram, the king of Tyre, said, by a letter that had been sent to Solomon: Because the Lord loved his people, for this reason he appointed you to reign over them. Chronicles : And he added, saying: Blessed is the Lord, the God of Israel, who made heaven and earth, who gave to king David a son who is wise, and learned, and intelligent as well as prudent, so that he may build a house to the Lord, and a palace for himself. Chronicles : Therefore, I have sent my father Hiram to you; he is a prudent and very knowledgeable man, Chronicles : the son of a woman from the daughters of Dan, whose father was a Tyrian, who knows how to work with gold and silver, with brass and iron, and with marble and timber, as well as with purple, and hyacinth, and fine linen, and scarlet. And he knows how to carve every kind of engraving, and how to devise prudently whatever may be necessary to the work, with your artisans and with the artisans of my lord David, your father. Chronicles : Therefore, send the wheat and barley and oil and wine, which you, my lord, have promised, to your own servants. Chronicles : Then we will cut down as much wood from Lebanon as you will need, and we will convey them as rafts by sea to Joppa. Then it will be for you to transfer them to Jerusalem. Chronicles : And so Solomon numbered all the new converts who were in the land of Israel, after the numbering that David his father had done, and they were found to be one hundred fifty thousand and three thousand six hundred. Chronicles : And he appointed seventy thousand of them, who would carry burdens on shoulders, and eighty thousand who would hew stones in the mountains, then three thousand and six hundred as overseers of the work of the people. Chronicles : And Solomon began to build the house of the Lord, in Jerusalem on mount Moriah, as it had been shown to David his father, at the place which David had prepared on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. Chronicles : Now he began to build in the second month, in the fourth year of his reign. Chronicles : And these are the foundations, which Solomon set forth so that he might build the house of God: the length in cubits by the first measure sixty, the width in cubits twenty. Chronicles : Truly, at the front, the portico, which was extended in length according to the measure of the width of the house, was of twenty cubits. Then the height was of one hundred twenty cubits. And he overlaid it on the interior with the purest gold. Chronicles : Also, he covered the greater house with wooden panels of spruce, and he affixed layers of refined gold through it all. And he engraved in them palm trees, and the likeness of little chains interlaced with one another. Chronicles : Also, he paved the floor of the temple with the most precious marble, of great beauty. Chronicles : Now the gold, with which he covered in layers the house and its beams and posts and walls and doors, was highly refined. And he engraved cherubim on the walls. Chronicles : Also, he made the house of the Holy of Holies. Its length, in accord with the width of the temple, was of twenty cubits. And its width, similarly, was of twenty cubits. And he covered it with layers of gold, of about six hundred talents. Chronicles : Then he also made nails of gold, such that each nail weighed fifty shekels. Also, he covered the upper rooms in gold. Chronicles : Now he also made, in the house of the Holy of Holies, two cherubim as a work of statues. And he covered them with gold. Chronicles : The wings of the cherubim extended for twenty cubits, such that one wing had five cubits and it touched the wall of the house, and the other, having five cubits, touched the wing of the other cherub. Chronicles : Similarly, the wing of the other cherub was five cubits, and it touched the wall, and his other wing of five cubits also touched the wing of the other cherub. Chronicles : And so the wings of both cherubim were stretched out and extended for twenty cubits. Now they were standing upright on their feet, and their faces were turned toward the exterior house. Chronicles : Also, he made a veil from hyacinth, purple, scarlet, and fine linen. And he wove within it cherubim. Chronicles : And also, before the doors of the temple, there were two pillars, having a height of thirty-five cubits. But their heads were of five cubits. Chronicles : Then too, there were something like little chains on the oracle, and he placed these upon the heads of the pillars. And there were one hundred pomegranates, which he placed between the little chains. Chronicles : Also, he placed these pillars in the vestibule of the temple, one to the right, and the other to the left. The one that was on the right, he called Jachin; and the one that was on the left, Boaz. Chronicles : Also, he made a brass altar of twenty cubits in length, and of twenty cubits in width, and of ten cubits in height, Chronicles : as well as a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in its circumference. It had five cubits in height, and a line of thirty cubits went around it on all sides. Chronicles : Also, under it there was the likeness of oxen. And certain engravings encircled the cavity of the sea, along ten cubits of the outside, as if in two rows. Now the oxen were molten. Chronicles : And the sea itself was placed upon the twelve oxen, three of which were looking toward the north, and another three toward the west, then another three toward the south, and the three that remained toward the east, having the sea imposed upon them. But the posteriors of the oxen were toward the interior, under the sea. Chronicles : Now its thickness had the measure of the palm of a hand, and its brim was like the lip of a cup, or like the outturned petal of a lily. And it held three thousand measures. Chronicles : Also, he made ten basins. And he placed five on the right, and five on the left, so that they might wash in them all the things that they were to offer as holocausts. But the priests were to be washed in the sea. Chronicles : Then he also made ten gold lampstands, according to the form by which they had been ordered to be made. And he set them in the temple, five on the right, and five on the left. Chronicles : Moreover, there were also ten tables. And he placed them in the temple, five on the right, and five on the left. Also, there were one hundred gold bowls. Chronicles : Then too, he made the court of the priests, and a great hall, and doors in the hall, which he covered with brass. Chronicles : Now he placed the sea on the right side, facing the east, toward the south. Chronicles : Then Hiram made cooking pots and hooks and bowls. And he completed every work of the king in the house of God, Chronicles : that is, the two pillars, and the crossbeams, and the heads, and something like a little net, which would cover the heads above the crossbeams, Chronicles : and also four hundred pomegranates, and two little nets, so that two rows of pomegranates were joined to each net, which would cover the crossbeams and the heads of the pillars. Chronicles : He also made bases; and basins that he placed upon the bases; Chronicles : one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea; Chronicles : and cooking pots and hooks and bowls. Hiram, his father, made all the vessels for Solomon, in the house of the Lord, from the purest brass. Chronicles : The king cast these in the region near the Jordan, in the clay soil between Succoth and Zeredah. Chronicles : Now the multitude of the vessels was innumerable, so much so that the weight of the brass was unknown. Chronicles : And Solomon made all the vessels for the house of God, and the gold altar, and the tables upon which were the bread of the presence; Chronicles : and also, of the purest gold, the lampstands with their lamps, to shine before the oracle, according to the rite; Chronicles : and certain flowers, and lamps, and gold tongs. All these were made from the purest gold. Chronicles : Also, the vessels for the perfumes, and the censers, and the bowls, and the little mortars were from the purest gold. And he engraved the doors of the inner temple, that is, for the Holy of Holies. And the doors of the outer temple were of gold. And so, every work was completed that Solomon made in the house of the Lord. Chronicles : Then Solomon brought in all the things that David his father had vowed, the silver, and the gold, and all the vessels, which he placed in the treasuries of the house of God. Chronicles : After this, he gathered together those greater by birth of Israel, and all the leaders of the tribes, and the heads of the families, from the sons of Israel, to Jerusalem, so that they might bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord from the City of David, which is Zion. Chronicles : And so, all the men of Israel went to the king, on the solemn day of the seventh month. Chronicles : And when all the elders of Israel had arrived, the Levites carried the ark, Chronicles : and they brought it in, along with all the equipment of the tabernacle. Then too, the priests with the Levites carried the vessels of the sanctuary, which were in the tabernacle. Chronicles : Now king Solomon, and the entire assembly of Israel, and all who had gathered together before the ark, were immolating rams and oxen without any number, for so great was the multitude of the victims. Chronicles : And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord to its place, that is, to the oracle of the temple, in the Holy of Holies, under the wings of the cherubim, Chronicles : so that the cherubim extended their wings over the place where the ark was positioned, and they covered the ark itself and its bars. Chronicles : But concerning the bars by which the ark was carried, because they were a little longer, the ends were able to be seen before the oracle. Yet truly, if anyone were a little ways toward the exterior, he would not be able to see them. And so the ark has been in that place, even to the present day. Chronicles : And there was nothing else in the ark, except the two tablets, which Moses had placed there at Horeb when the Lord gave the law to the sons of Israel, at the departure from Egypt. Chronicles : And having gone out from the Sanctuary, the priests for all the priests who were able to be found there were sanctified, and in that time the turns and orders of the ministries had not yet been divided among them Chronicles : with both the Levites and the singing men, that is, those who were under Asaph, and those who were under Heman, and those who were under Jeduthun, with their sons and brothers, clothed in fine linen, sounded out with cymbals, and psalteries, and harps, standing toward the eastern side of the altar. And with them were one hundred twenty priests, sounding out with trumpets. Chronicles : And when they all sounded out together, with trumpets, and voice, and cymbals, and pipes, and with various kinds of musical instruments, lifting their voice on high, the sound was heard from far away, so that when they had begun to praise the Lord, and to say, Confess to the Lord, for he is good; for his mercy is eternal, the house of God was filled with a cloud. Chronicles : Neither were the priests able to stand and to minister, because of the cloud. For the glory of the Lord had filled the house of God. Chronicles : Then Solomon said: The Lord has promised that he would dwell in a cloud. Chronicles : But I have built a house to his name, so that he may dwell there forever. Chronicles : And the king turned his face, and he blessed the entire multitude of Israel, for the whole crowd was standing and attentive and he said: Chronicles : Blessed is the Lord, the God of Israel, who has completed the work that he spoke to David my father, saying: Chronicles : From the day when I led my people away from the land of Egypt, I did not choose a city from all the tribes of Israel, so that a house would be built in it to my name. And I did not choose any other man, so that he would be the ruler of my people Israel. Chronicles : But I chose Jerusalem, so that my name would be in it. And I chose David, so that I might appoint him over my people Israel. Chronicles : And though David, my father, had decided that he would build a house to the name of the Lord God of Israel, Chronicles : the Lord said to him: In so far as it was your will that you build a house to my name, certainly you have done well in having such a will. Chronicles : But you shall not build the house. Truly, your son, who will go forth from your loins, shall build a house to my name. Chronicles : Therefore, the Lord has accomplished his word, which he had spoken. And I have risen up in place of my father David, and I sit upon the throne of Israel, just as the Lord spoke. And I have built a house to the name of the Lord, the God of Israel. Chronicles : And I have placed in it the ark, in which is the covenant of the Lord that he formed with the sons of Israel. Chronicles : Then he stood before the altar of the Lord, facing the entire multitude of Israel, and he extended his hands. Chronicles : For indeed, Solomon had made a bronze base, and he had positioned it in the midst of the hall; it held five cubits in length, and five cubits in width, and three cubits in height. And he stood upon it. And next, kneeling down while facing the entire multitude of Israel, and lifting up his palms towards heaven, Chronicles : he said: O Lord God of Israel, there is no god like you in heaven or on earth. You preserve covenant and mercy with your servants, who walk before you with all their hearts. Chronicles : You fulfilled for your servant David, my father, whatsoever you had said to him. And you carried out the deed that you promised with your mouth, just as the present time proves. Chronicles : Now then, O Lord God of Israel, fulfill for your servant David, my father, whatsoever you said to him, saying: There shall not fail to be a man from you before me, who will sit upon the throne of Israel, yet only if your sons will guard their ways, and will walk in my law, just as you also have walked before me. Chronicles : And now, O Lord God of Israel, let your word be confirmed that you spoke to your servant David. Chronicles : How then is it to be believe that God would dwell with men upon the earth? If heaven and the heavens of the heavens do not contain you, how much less this house that I have built? Chronicles : But it has been done for this only, so that you may look with favor upon the prayer of your servant, and on his supplication, O Lord my God, and so that you may hear the prayers which your servant pours out before you, Chronicles : and so that you may open your eyes over this house, day and night, over the place where you promised that your name would be invoked, Chronicles : and so that you may heed the prayer which your servant is praying within it, and so that you may heed the prayers of your servant and of your people Israel. Whoever will pray in this place, listen from your habitation, that is, from heaven, and forgive. Chronicles : If anyone will have sinned against his neighbor, and he arrives to swear against him, and to bind himself with a curse before the altar in this house, Chronicles : you will hear him from heaven, and you will execute justice for your servants, so that you return, to the iniquitous man, his own way upon his own head, and so that you vindicate the just man, repaying him according to his own justice. Chronicles : If your people Israel will have been overwhelmed by their enemies, for they will sin against you and having been converted will do penance, and if they will have beseeched your name, and will have prayed in this place, Chronicles : you will heed them from heaven, and you will forgive the sin of your people Israel, and you will lead them back into the land that you gave to them and to their fathers. Chronicles : If the heavens have been closed, so that rain does not fall, because of the sin of the people, and if they will petition you in this place, and confess to your name, and be converted from their sins when you will afflict them, Chronicles : heed them from heaven, O Lord, and forgive the sins of your servants and of your people Israel, and teach them the good way, by which they may advance, and give rain to the land that you gave to your people as a possession. Chronicles : If a famine will have risen up in the land, or pestilence, or fungus, or mildew, or locusts, or beetles, or if enemies will have laid waste to the countryside and will have besieged the gates of the cities, or whatever scourge or infirmity will have pressed upon them, Chronicles : if anyone from your people Israel, knowing his own scourge and infirmity, will have made supplication and will have extended his hands in this house, Chronicles : you will heed him from heaven, indeed from your sublime habitation, and you will forgive, and you will repay each one according to his ways, which you know him to hold in his heart. For you alone know the hearts of the sons of men. Chronicles : So may they fear you, and so may they walk in your ways, during all the days that they live upon the face of the land, which you gave to our fathers. Chronicles : Also, if the outsider, who is not from your people Israel, will have arrived from a far away land, because of your great name, and because of your robust hand and your outstretched arm, and if he will adore in this place, Chronicles : you will heed him from heaven, your most firm habitation, and you will accomplish all the things about which this sojourner will have called out to you, so that all the people of the earth may know your name, and may fear you, just as your people Israel do, and so that they may know that your name is invoked over this house, which I have built. Chronicles : If, having gone out to war against their adversaries along the way that you will send them, your people adore you facing in the direction of this city, which you have chosen, and of this house, which I have built to your name, Chronicles : you will heed their prayers from heaven, and their supplications, and you will vindicate them. Chronicles : But if they will have sinned against you for there is no man who does not sin and you will have become angry against them, and if you will have delivered them to their enemies, and so they lead them away as captives to a far away land, or even to one that is near, Chronicles : and if, having been converted in their heart in the land to which they had been led as captives, they will do penance, and beseech you in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned; we have committed iniquity; we have acted unjustly, Chronicles : and if they will have returned to you, with their whole heart and with their whole soul, in the land of their captivity to which they were led away, and if they will adore you in the direction of their own land, which you gave to their fathers, and of the city, which you have chosen, and of the house, which I have built to your name, Chronicles : from heaven, that is, from your firm habitation, you will heed their prayers, and you will accomplish judgment, and you will forgive your people, even though they are sinners. Chronicles : For you are my God. Let your eyes be open, I beg you, and let your ears be attentive to the prayer that is made in this place. Chronicles : Now therefore, rise up, O Lord God, to your resting place, you and the ark of your strength. Let your priests, O Lord God, be clothed with salvation, and let your holy ones rejoice in what is good. Chronicles : O Lord God, may you not turn away from the face of your Christ. Remember the mercies of your servant, David. Chronicles : And when Solomon had completed pouring out his prayers, fire descended from heaven, and it devoured the holocausts and the victims. And the majesty of the Lord filled the house. Chronicles : Neither were the priests able to enter into the temple of the Lord, because the majesty of the Lord had filled the temple of the Lord. Chronicles : Moreover, all the sons of Israel saw the fire descending, and the glory of the Lord upon the house. And falling prone upon the ground, on the layer of pavement stones, they adored and praised the Lord: For he is good. For his mercy is everlasting. Chronicles : Then the king and all the people were immolating victims before the Lord. Chronicles : And so, king Solomon slaughtered victims: twenty-two thousand oxen, and one hundred twenty thousand rams. And the king and the entire people dedicated the house of God. Chronicles : Then the priests and the Levites were standing in their offices, with the instruments of music for the Lord, which king David made in order to praise the Lord: For his mercy is eternal. And they were playing the hymns of David with their hands. And the priests were sounding out with trumpets before them, and all of Israel was standing. Chronicles : Also, Solomon sanctified the middle of the atrium in front of the temple of the Lord. For he had offered the holocausts and the fat of peace offerings in that place because the bronze altar, which he had made, had not been able to support the holocausts and the sacrifices and the fat. Chronicles : Therefore, Solomon kept the solemnity, at that time, for seven days, and all of Israel with him, a very great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath, even to the torrent of Egypt. Chronicles : And on the eighth day, he held a solemn gathering, because he had dedicated the altar over seven days, and he had celebrated the solemnity over seven days. Chronicles : And so, on the twenty-third day of the seventh month, he dismissed the people to their dwellings, joyful and glad over the good that the Lord had done for David, and for Solomon, and for his people Israel. Chronicles : And Solomon completed the house of the Lord, and the house of the king, and all that he had resolved in his heart to do for the house of the Lord, and for his own house. And he prospered. Chronicles : Then the Lord appeared to him by night, and said: I have heard your prayer, and I have chosen this place for myself as a house of sacrifice. Chronicles : If I close up heaven, so that no rain will fall, or if I order and instruct the locust to devour the land, or if I send a pestilence among my people, Chronicles : and if my people, over whom my name has been invoked, being converted, will have petitioned me and sought my face, and will have done penance for their wicked ways, then I will heed them from heaven, and I will forgive their sins, and I will heal their land. Chronicles : Also, my eyes will be open, and my ears will be attentive, to the prayer of him who shall pray in this place. Chronicles : For I have chosen and sanctified this place, so that my name may be there continually, and so that my eyes and my heart may remain there, for all days. Chronicles : And as for you, if you will walk before me, just as your father David walked, and if you will act in accord with all that I have instructed you, and if you will observe my justices and judgments, Chronicles : I will raise up the throne of your kingdom, just as I promised to your father David, saying: There shall not be taken away a man from your stock who will be ruler in Israel. Chronicles : But if you will have turned away, and will have forsaken my justices and my precepts, which I have set before you, and going astray, you serve strange gods, and you adore them, Chronicles : I will uproot you from my land, which I gave to you, and from this house, which I sanctified to my name, and I will cast it away from before my face, and I will deliver it to be a parable and an example for all the peoples. Chronicles : And this house will be like a proverb to all who pass by. And being astonished, they shall say: Why has the Lord acted this way toward this land and toward this house? Chronicles : And they shall respond: Because they abandoned the Lord, the God of their fathers, who led them away from the land of Egypt, and they took hold of foreign gods, and they adored and worshipped them. Therefore, all these evils have overwhelmed them. Chronicles : Then, twenty years having passed since Solomon built the house of the Lord and his own house, Chronicles : he built the cities that Hiram had given to Solomon, and he caused the sons of Israel to live there. Chronicles : Also, he went to Hamath Zobah, and he obtained it. Chronicles : And he built Palmira in the desert, and he built very fortified cities in Hamath. Chronicles : And he built upper Beth-horon and lower Beth-horon, as walled cities, having gates and bars and locks, Chronicles : as well as Baalath, and all the very strong cities which were of Solomon, and all the cities of the chariots, and the cities of the horsemen. Everything whatsoever that Solomon willed and decided, he built in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and throughout the entire land of his authority. Chronicles : All the people who had been left from the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, those who were not from the stock of Israel, Chronicles : those of their sons and their posterity whom the sons of Israel had not put to death, Solomon subjugated as tributaries, even to this day. Chronicles : But he did not appoint anyone from the sons of Israel to serve in the works of the king. For they were men of war, and first rulers, and commanders of his chariots and horsemen. Chronicles : Now all the leaders of the army of king Solomon were two hundred fifty, who were instructing the people. Chronicles : Truly, he transferred the daughter of Pharaoh, from the City of David, to the house that he had built for her. For the king said: My wife shall not live in the house of David, king of Israel, for it has been sanctified. For the ark of the Lord has entered into it. Chronicles : Then Solomon offered holocausts to the Lord on the altar of the Lord, which he had constructed before the portico, Chronicles : so that every day there would be an offering on it, in accord with precept of Moses, on the Sabbaths, and on the new moons, and three times a year on the feast days, that is, on the solemnity of unleavened bread, and on the solemnity of weeks, and in the solemnity of tabernacles. Chronicles : And he appointed, in accord with the plan of his father David, the offices of the priests in their ministries; and those of the Levites, in their orders, so that they might praise and minister before the priests according to the ritual of each day; and the porters, in their divisions, from gate to gate. For so had David, the man of God, instructed. Chronicles : Neither the priests, nor the Levites, transgressed against the commands of the king, in all that he had instructed, and in the keeping of the treasuries. Chronicles : Solomon had all the expenses prepared, from the day on which he founded the house of the Lord, even until the day when he perfected it. Chronicles : Then Solomon went away to Eziongeber, and to Eloth, on the coast of the Red Sea, which is in the land of Edom. Chronicles : And Hiram sent to him ships, by the hands of his servants, sailors and skillful navigators of the sea, and they went away with the servants of Solomon to Ophir. And they took from there four hundred fifty talents of gold, and they brought it to king Solomon. Chronicles : Also, when the queen of Sheba had heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to Jerusalem, with great riches and with camels which were carrying aromatics, and very much gold, and precious gems, so that she might test him with enigmas. And when she had approached Solomon, she spoke to him all that was in her heart. Chronicles : And Solomon explained for her all that she had proposed. And there was nothing that he did not make clear to her. Chronicles : And after she saw these things, specifically, the wisdom of Solomon, and the house which he had built, Chronicles : indeed also the foods of his table, and the habitations of the servants, and the duties of his ministers, and their apparel, and also his cupbearers and their garments, and the victims which he was immolating in the house of the Lord, there was no longer any spirit in her, due to astonishment. Chronicles : And she said to the king: The word is true, which I had heard in my own land, about your virtues and wisdom. Chronicles : I did not believe those who described it, until I had arrived and my eyes had seen, and I had proven that not even half of your wisdom had been described to me. You have exceeded your fame with your virtue. Chronicles : Blessed are your men, and blessed are your servants, who stand before you at all times and listen to your wisdom. Chronicles : Blessed is the Lord your God, who willed to set you upon his throne as a king for the Lord your God. Since God loves Israel, he wishes to preserve them unto eternity. For this reason, he appointed you as king over them, so that you may accomplish judgment and justice. Chronicles : Then she gave to the king one hundred twenty talents of gold, and an exceedingly great abundance of aromatics, and very precious gems. Never were there such aromatics as those that the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon. Chronicles : Then too, the servants of Hiram, with the servants of Solomon, brought gold from Ophir, and wood from thyine trees, and very precious gems. Chronicles : And the king made, from this particular thyine wood, steps in the house of the Lord, and in the house of the king, and also harps and psalteries for the singing men. Never was there seen such wood in the land of Judah. Chronicles : Then king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all that she desired, and all that she requested, and much more than what she had brought to him. And returning, she went away to her own land with her servants. Chronicles : Now the weight of the gold, which was being brought to Solomon throughout each year, was six hundred sixty-six talents of gold, Chronicles : apart from the sum that the legates of various nations and the merchants were accustomed to bring, and apart from the gold and silver that all the kings of Arabia, and the princes of the lands, were bringing together for Solomon. Chronicles : And so, king Solomon made two hundred gold spears, from six hundred gold pieces, the amount used for each spear, Chronicles : and also three hundred gold shields, from three hundred gold pieces, which covered each shield. And the king placed them in the armory, which was situated in a forest. Chronicles : Also, the king made a great ivory throne, and he clothed it with the purest gold. Chronicles : And there were six steps, by which he would ascend to the throne, and a footstool of gold, and two arms, one on each side, and two lions standing beside the arms. Chronicles : Moreover, there were twelve additional little lions standing upon the six steps on both sides. There was no similar throne in all the kingdoms. Chronicles : Also, all the vessels for the feasts of the king were of gold, and the vessels of the forest house of Lebanon were from the purest gold. For silver in those days was considered as nothing. Chronicles : For indeed, the ships of the king went to Tarshish, with the servants of Hiram, once every three years. And they brought from there gold, and silver, and ivory, and primates, and peacocks. Chronicles : And so, Solomon was magnified above all the kings of the earth in wealth and glory. Chronicles : And all the kings of the lands were desiring to see the face of Solomon, so that they might hear the wisdom that God had granted to his heart. Chronicles : And they were bringing to him gifts, vessels of silver and of gold, and garments, and armor, and aromatics, and horses, and mules, throughout each year. Chronicles : Also, Solomon had forty thousand horses in the stables, and twelve thousand chariots and horsemen, and he appointed them to the cities of the chariots, and where the king was in Jerusalem. Chronicles : Now he also exercised authority over all the kings from the river Euphrates as far as the land of the Philistines, and as far as the borders of Egypt. Chronicles : And he brought forth so much silver that it was as plentiful in Jerusalem as stones. And cedar trees were as great in number as the sycamores that spring up in the plains. Chronicles : And horses were brought to him from Egypt and from every region. Chronicles : Now the rest of the works of Solomon, the first and the last, have been written in the words of Nathan, the prophet, and in the books of Ahijah, the Shilonite, as well as in the vision of Iddo, the seer, against Jeroboam, the son of Nabat. Chronicles : And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem, over all of Israel, for forty years. Chronicles : And he slept with his fathers. And they buried him in the City of David. And his son, Rehoboam, reigned in his place. Chronicles : Now Rehoboam set out for Shechem. For in that place all of Israel had convened, so that they might appoint him as king. Chronicles : But when Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, who was in Egypt, indeed he had fled to that place from Solomon had heard it, he promptly returned. Chronicles : And they summoned him, and he arrived with all of Israel. And they spoke to Rehoboam, saying: Chronicles : Your father pressed upon us a very difficult yoke. You should govern us more lightly than your father, who imposed on us a heavy servitude, and so lift up some of the burden, so that we may serve you. Chronicles : But he said, Return to me after three days. And when the people had gone away, Chronicles : he took counsel with the elders, who had stood before his father Solomon while he was still living, saying, What counsel would you give to me, so that I may respond to the people? Chronicles : And they said to him, If you please this people, and if you soothe them with words of clemency, they will be your servants for all days. Chronicles : But he set aside the counsel of the elders, and he began to have discussion with the youth, who had been raised with him and who were among his companions. Chronicles : And he said to them: How does it seem to you? Or how should I respond to this people, who have said to me, Lift up the yoke that your father imposed upon us? Chronicles : But they responded like youths, having been raised with him in luxury, and they said: So shall you speak to the people, who said to you, Your father made our yoke heavy; you should lighten it, and so shall you respond to them: My little finger is thicker than the back of my father. Chronicles : My father imposed a heavy yoke upon you, and I will place more weight upon it. My father cut you with whips; truly, I will beat you with scorpions. Chronicles : Then Jeroboam, and the entire people, went to Rehoboam on the third day, just as he had instructed them. Chronicles : And the king responded harshly, abandoning the counsel of the elders. Chronicles : And he spoke according to the will of the youths: My father imposed a heavy yoke upon you, which I will make heavier. My father cut you with whips; truly, I will beat you with scorpions. Chronicles : And he did not acquiesce to the pleadings of the people. For it was the will of God that his word be fulfilled, which he had spoken by the hand of Ahijah, the Shilonite, to Jeroboam, the son of Nabat. Chronicles : Then the entire people, speaking more harshly to the king, spoke to him in this way: There is no portion for us in David, and there is no inheritance in the son of Jesse. Return to your dwellings, O Israel. Then you, O David, shall pasture your own house. And Israel went away to their dwellings. Chronicles : But Rehoboam reigned over the sons of Israel who were living in the cities of Judah. Chronicles : And king Rehoboam sent Aduram, who was in charge of the tributes. And the sons of Israel stoned him, and he died. And so king Rehoboam hurried to climb into the chariot, and he fled to Jerusalem. Chronicles : And Israel withdrew from the house of David, even to this day. Chronicles : Then Rehoboam went to Jerusalem, and he called together the entire house of Judah and of Benjamin, one hundred eighty thousand elect men of war, so that he might contend against Israel, and turn back his kingdom to himself. Chronicles : And the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah, the man of God, saying: Chronicles : Speak to Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, the king of Judah, and to all of Israel who are of Judah, or of Benjamin: Chronicles : Thus says the Lord: You shall not ascend and fight against your brothers. Let each one return to his own house. For it is by my will that this has happened. And when they had heard the word of the Lord, they turned back, and they did not continue on against Jeroboam. Chronicles : Then Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem, and he built fortified cities in Judah. Chronicles : And he built up Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa, Chronicles : and also Bethzur, and Soco, and Adullam, Chronicles : indeed also Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph, Chronicles : then too Adoram, and Lachish, and Azekah, Chronicles : as well as Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which were very fortified cities in Judah and in Benjamin. Chronicles : And when he had enclosed them with walls, he placed in them rulers, and storehouses of provisions, that is, of oil and wine. Chronicles : Moreover, in each city he made an armory of shields and spears, and he strengthened them with the utmost diligence. And he ruled over Judah and Benjamin. Chronicles : Then the priests and Levites, who were in all of Israel, came to him from all their settlements, Chronicles : leaving behind their suburbs and possessions, and crossing over to Judah and to Jerusalem. For Jeroboam and his followers had cast them out, so that they could not exercise the priestly office to the Lord. Chronicles : And he appointed for himself priests of high places, and of demons, and of calves that he had made. Chronicles : Moreover, out of all the tribes of Israel, whosoever would give their heart so that they sought the Lord God of Israel, they went to Jerusalem to immolate their victims before the Lord, the God of their fathers. Chronicles : And they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and they confirmed Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, for three years. For they walked in the ways of David and of Solomon, but only for three years. Chronicles : Then Rehoboam took as wife Mahalath, the daughter of Jerimoth, son of David, and also Abihail, the daughter of Eliab, son of Jesse. Chronicles : They bore sons for him: Jeush, and Shemariah, and Zaham. Chronicles : And also after her, he married Maacah, the daughter of Absalom, who bore for him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith. Chronicles : But Rehoboam loved Maacah, the daughter of Absalom, above all his wives and concubines. For he had taken eighteen wives and sixty concubines. And he conceived twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters. Chronicles : Truly, he appointed as the head, Abijah, the son of Maacah, to be the ruler over all his brothers. For he thought to make him king, Chronicles : since he was wiser and more powerful than all his sons, even in all the regions of Judah and Benjamin, and in all the fortified cities. And he provided them with very much food, and he sought many wives. Chronicles : And when the kingdom of Rehoboam had been strengthened and fortified, he abandoned the law of the Lord, and all of Israel with him. Chronicles : Then, in the fifth year of the reign of Rehoboam, Shishak, the king of Egypt, ascended against Jerusalem for they had sinned against the Lord Chronicles : with one thousand two hundred chariots and sixty thousand horsemen. And the common people could not be numbered who had arrived with him from Egypt, namely, the Libyans, and the Troglodytes, and the Ethiopians. Chronicles : And he seized the most fortified cities in Judah, and he went even to Jerusalem. Chronicles : Then Shemaiah, the prophet, entered to Rehoboam, and to the leaders of Judah who had gathered together in Jerusalem while fleeing from Shishak, and he said to them: Thus says the Lord: You have abandoned me, and so I have abandoned you into the hand of Shishak. Chronicles : And the leaders of Israel, and the king, being in consternation, said, The Lord is just. Chronicles : And when the Lord had seen that they were humbled, the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah, saying: Because they have been humbled, I will not disperse them. And I will give to them a little help, and my fury will not rain down upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak. Chronicles : Yet truly, they shall serve him, so that they may know the difference between my servitude, and the servitude of a kingdom of the lands. Chronicles : And so Shishak, the king of Egypt, withdrew from Jerusalem, taking up the treasures of the house of the Lord and of the house of the king. And he took away everything with him, even the gold shields that Solomon had made. Chronicles : In place of these, the king made bronze ones, and he delivered them to the leaders of the shield bearers, who were guarding the vestibule of the palace. Chronicles : And when the king would enter into the house of the Lord, the shield bearers would arrive and take them, and they would carry them back to their armory. Chronicles : Yet truly, because they were humbled, the wrath of the Lord turned away from them, and so they were not utterly destroyed. And indeed, good works were also found in Judah. Chronicles : Therefore, king Rehoboam was strengthened in Jerusalem, and he reigned. He was forty-one years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city that the Lord chose out of all the tribes of Israel, so that he might confirm his name there. Now the name of his mother was Naamah, an Ammonite. Chronicles : But he did evil, and he did not prepare his heart so as to seek the Lord. Chronicles : Truly, the works of Rehoboam, the first and the last, have been written in the books of Shemaiah, the prophet, and of Iddo, the seer, and diligently set forth. And Rehoboam and Jeroboam fought against one another during all their days. Chronicles : And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the City of David. And his son, Abijah, reigned in his place. Chronicles : In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam, Abijah reigned over Judah. Chronicles : He reigned for three years in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother was Micaiah, the daughter of Uriel, from Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. Chronicles : And when Abijah had undertaken the conflict, and he had with him four hundred thousand elect men, very fit for war, Jeroboam set up a battle line opposite him of eight hundred thousand men, who were also elect and very strong in warfare. Chronicles : Then Abijah stood upon mount Zemaraim, which was in Ephraim, and he said: Listen to me, Jeroboam and all of Israel. Chronicles : Are you ignorant that the Lord, the God of Israel, gave David the kingship over Israel for all time, to him and to his sons, by a covenant of salt? Chronicles : But Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, the servant of Solomon, son of David, rose up and rebelled against his lord. Chronicles : And there were gathered to him very vain men, and sons of Belial. And they prevailed against Rehoboam, the son of Solomon. For Rehoboam was inexperienced, and he had a fearful heart, and so he was unable to resist them. Chronicles : Now therefore, you say that you are able to resist the kingdom of the Lord, which he possesses through the sons of David, and you have a great multitude of people, and gold calves, which Jeroboam made for you as gods. Chronicles : And you have cast out the priests of the Lord, the sons of Aaron, as well as the Levites. And like all the peoples of the lands, you have made priests for yourselves. Anyone who is willing to come and perform the ritual by his hand, with a bull from the herd and with seven rams, is made a priest of those who are not gods. Chronicles : But the Lord is our God, and we have not forsaken him. And the priests who minister to the Lord are from the sons of Aaron. And the Levites are in their proper order. Chronicles : Also, they offer holocausts to the Lord, each and every day, morning and evening, and incense composed according to the precept of the law, and the bread of the presence on a very pure table. And there is with us the gold lampstand with its lamps, so that they may burn continually in the evening. For certainly, we keep the precepts of the Lord our God, whom you have forsaken. Chronicles : Therefore, God is the commander of our army, with his priests, who sound the trumpets that ring out against you. O sons of Israel, do not choose to fight against the Lord, the God of your fathers. For it is not expedient for you. Chronicles : While he was speaking these things, Jeroboam set in motion an ambush behind them. And while they stood facing the enemy, without Judah realizing it, his army circled around. Chronicles : And looking back, Judah saw the war threatening in front and behind, and they cried out to the Lord. And the priests began to sound the trumpets. Chronicles : And all the men of Judah shouted out. And behold, when they cried out, God terrified Jeroboam, and all of Israel who were standing in opposition to Abijah and Judah. Chronicles : And the sons of Israel fled from Judah, and the Lord delivered them into their hand. Chronicles : Therefore, Abijah and his people struck them with a great slaughter. And five hundred thousand strong men of Israel fell wounded. Chronicles : And the sons of Israel were humiliated at that time. And the sons of Judah were very greatly strengthened, because they had trusted in the Lord, the God of their fathers. Chronicles : Then Abijah pursued the fleeing Jeroboam. And he seized cities from him: Bethel and her daughters, and Jeshanah with her daughters, and also Ephron and her daughters. Chronicles : And Jeroboam no longer had the strength to resist, in the days of Abijah. And the Lord struck him, and he died. Chronicles : And so Abijah, having been strengthened in his authority, took fourteen wives. And he procreated twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters. Chronicles : Now the rest of the words of Abijah, and his ways and works, have been written very diligently in the book of Iddo, the prophet. Chronicles : Then Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the City of David. And his son, Asa, reigned in his place. During his days, the land was quiet for ten years. Chronicles : Now Asa did what was good and pleasing in the sight of his God. And he overturned the altars of foreign worship, and the high places. Chronicles : And he broke apart the statues, and he cut down the sacred groves. Chronicles : And he instructed Judah that they should seek the Lord, the God of their fathers, and that they should carry out the law and all the commandments. Chronicles : And he took away, from all the cities of Judah, the altars and the shrines. And he reigned in peace. Chronicles : Also, he built fortified cities in Judah. For it was quiet, and in his time no wars had arisen. For the Lord was generously granting peace. Chronicles : Then he said to Judah: Let us build these cities, and strengthen them with walls, and fortify them with towers and gates and bars, while all things are at rest from wars. For we have sought the Lord, the God of our fathers, and he has granted to us peace on every side. And so they built, and there was nothing to impede them from building. Chronicles : Now Asa had in his army three hundred thousand men of Judah, carrying shields and spears, and truly, of Benjamin, two hundred eighty thousand men with shields and bows. All of these were very valiant men. Chronicles : Then Zerah, the Ethiopian, went forth against them with his army of one million men, and three hundred chariots. And he approached as far as Mareshah. Chronicles : And Asa traveled to meet him, and he set up a battle line for the war in the Valley of Zephathah, which is near Mareshah. Chronicles : And he called upon the Lord God, and he said: O Lord, there is no difference to you, whether you assist by few, or by many. Help us, O Lord our God. For having faith in you and in your name, we have gone forth against this multitude. O Lord, you are our God. Do not allow man to prevail against you. Chronicles : And so the Lord terrified the Ethiopians before Asa and Judah. And the Ethiopians fled. Chronicles : And Asa, and the people who were with him, pursued them as far as Gerar. And the Ethiopians fell, even unto utter destruction, for the Lord was striking, and his army was battling, and they were destroyed. Therefore, they took many spoils. Chronicles : And they struck all the cities surrounding Gerar. For indeed, a great fear had overwhelmed everyone. And they despoiled the cities, and they carried away much plunder. Chronicles : Then too, destroying the fencing for the sheep, they took an innumerable multitude of cattle and camels. And they returned to Jerusalem. Chronicles : Now Azariah, the son of Oded, had the Spirit of God within him. Chronicles : And he went out to meet Asa, and he said to him: Listen to me, Asa and all of Judah and Benjamin. The Lord is with you, because you have been with him. If you seek him, you will find him. But if you abandon him, he will abandon you. Chronicles : Then many days will pass in Israel, apart from the true God, and apart from a learned priest, and apart from the law. Chronicles : And when, in their anguish, they will have returned to the Lord, the God of Israel, and will have sought him, they shall find him. Chronicles : In that time, there will be no peace for those who depart and those who enter. Instead, there will be terror on every side, among all the inhabitants of the lands. Chronicles : For nation will fight against nation, and city against city. For the Lord will disturb them with every anguish. Chronicles : But as for you, be strengthened, and do not let your hands be weakened. For there will be a reward for your work. Chronicles : And when Asa had heard these particular words, and the prophecy of the prophet Azariah, the son of Oded, he was strengthened, and he took away the idols from the entire land of Judah, and from Benjamin, and from the cities that he had seized of mount Ephraim, and he dedicated the altar of the Lord, which was before the portico of the Lord. Chronicles : And he gathered together all of Judah and Benjamin, and with them the new arrivals from Ephraim and Manasseh and Simeon. For many had fled to him from Israel, seeing that the Lord his God was with him. Chronicles : And when they had arrived in Jerusalem, in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa, Chronicles : they immolated to the Lord on that day, from the best of the spoils and from the plunder that they had brought: seven hundred oxen and seven thousand rams. Chronicles : And he entered, according to custom, in order to confirm the covenant, so that they would seek the Lord, the God of their fathers, with their whole heart and with their whole soul. Chronicles : But if anyone, he said, will not seek the Lord, the God of Israel, let him die, from the least even to the greatest, from man even to woman. Chronicles : And they swore to the Lord, with a great voice, in jubilation, and with the blare of trumpets, and with the sound of horns, Chronicles : all who were in Judah swore with a curse. For with all their heart they swore, and with all their will they sought and found him. And the Lord granted rest on all sides to them. Chronicles : Then too, Maacah, the mother of king Asa, he deposed from the august authority, because she had made an idol of Priapus within a sacred grove. And he entirely crushed it, breaking it into pieces, and he burned it at the torrent Kidron. Chronicles : But some high places were left in Israel. Even so, the heart of Asa was perfect during all his days. Chronicles : And whatever his father or he himself had vowed, he brought into the house of the Lord: silver and gold, and vessels for various uses. Chronicles : Truly, there was no war, until the thirty-fifth year of the kingdom of Asa. Chronicles : Then, in the thirty-sixth year of his reign, Baasha, the king of Israel, ascended against Judah. And he encircled Ramah with a wall, so that no one could safely depart or enter from the kingdom of Asa. Chronicles : Therefore, Asa brought forth silver and gold from the treasuries of the house of the Lord, and from the treasuries of the king. And he sent to Benhadad, the king of Syria, who was living in Damascus, saying: Chronicles : There is a pact between me and you. Also, my father and your father had an agreement. For this reason, I have sent silver and gold to you, so that you may break the pact that you have with Baasha, the king of Israel, and so that you may cause him to withdraw from me. Chronicles : And when he verified this, Benhadad sent the leaders of his armies to the cities of Israel. And they struck Ahion, and Dan, and Abelmaim, and all the walled cities of Naphtali. Chronicles : And when Baasha had heard of it, he ceased to build around Ramah, and he interrupted his work. Chronicles : Then king Asa took all of Judah, and they carried away from Ramah the stones and the wood that Baasha had prepared for the things to be built. And he built up Gibeah and Mizpah with them. Chronicles : In that time, the prophet Hanani went to Asa, the king of Judah, and he said to him: Because you have faith in the king of Syria, and not in the Lord your God, therefore the army of the king of Syria has escaped from your hand. Chronicles : Were not the Ethiopians and the Libyans much more numerous in chariots, and horsemen, and an exceedingly great multitude? Yet when you believed in the Lord, he delivered them into your hand. Chronicles : For the eyes of the Lord contemplate the entire earth, and offer fortitude to those who believe in him with a perfect heart. And so, you acted foolishly. And so, because of this, from the present time wars shall rise up against you. Chronicles : And Asa was angry against the seer, and he ordered him to be sent into prison. For indeed, he had been very indignant over this. And in that time, he put to death very many of the people. Chronicles : But the works of Asa, the first and the last, have been written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. Chronicles : And now Asa became ill, in the thirty-ninth year of his reign, with a very severe pain in his feet. And yet, in his infirmity, he did not seek the Lord. Instead, he trusted more in the skill of physicians. Chronicles : And he slept with his fathers. And he died in the forty-first year of his reign. Chronicles : And they buried him in his own sepulcher, which he had made for himself in the City of David. And they placed him upon his bed, full of the aromatics and ointments of courtesans, which were composed with the skill of the perfumers. And they burned these over him with very great ostentation. Chronicles : Then Jehoshaphat, his son, reigned in his place. And he grew strong against Israel. Chronicles : And he appointed numbers of soldiers in all the cities of Judah that had been fortified with walls. And he placed garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim that his father Asa had seized. Chronicles : And the Lord was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father, David. And he did not trust in the Baals, Chronicles : but in the God of his father. And he advanced in his precepts, and not according to the sins of Israel. Chronicles : And the Lord confirmed the kingdom in his hand. And all of Judah gave gifts to Jehoshaphat. And innumerable riches were brought to him, and much glory. Chronicles : And when his heart had taken courage because of the ways of the Lord, he now also took away the high places and the sacred groves from Judah. Chronicles : Then, in the third year of his reign, he sent Benhail, and Obadiah, and Zechariah, and Nethanel, and Micaiah, from among his leaders, so that they might teach in the cites of Judah. Chronicles : And with them were the Levites Shemaiah and Nethaniah and Zebadiah, and also Asahel and Shemiramoth and Jehonathan, and the Levites Adonijah and Tobijah and Tobadonijah. And with them were the priests Elishama and Jehoram. Chronicles : And they were teaching the people in Judah, having with them the book of the law of the Lord. And they were traveling through all the cities of Judah, and were instructing the people. Chronicles : And so, the fear of the Lord fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands which were around Judah. And they did not dare to make war against Jehoshaphat. Chronicles : Moreover, the Philistines carried gifts to Jehoshaphat, and a tribute in silver. Also, the Arabians brought cattle: seven thousand seven hundred rams, and the same number of he-goats. Chronicles : Therefore, Jehoshaphat increased and was magnified, even on high. And in Judah, he built houses in the likeness of towers, and walled cities. Chronicles : And he prepared many works in the cities of Judah. Also, there were men experienced in warfare in Jerusalem, Chronicles : and this is the number of them, by each of the houses and families. In Judah, the leader of the army was Adnah, the commander; and with him were three hundred thousand very experienced men. Chronicles : After him, Jehohanan was the leader; and with him were two hundred eighty thousand. Chronicles : Also after him, there was Amasiah, the son of Zichri, who was consecrated to the Lord; and with him were two hundred thousand strong men. Chronicles : Following him, there was Eliada, who was experienced in battle; and with him were two hundred thousand, holding bow and shield. Chronicles : Then too, after him, there was Jehozabad; and with him were one hundred eighty thousand lightly-armed solders. Chronicles : All these were at the hand of the king, aside from the others, whom he had positioned in the walled cities, in all of Judah. Chronicles : Therefore, Jehoshaphat was wealthy and very famous, and he was joined by affinity to Ahab. Chronicles : And after some years, he descended to him in Samaria. And upon his arrival, Ahab slaughtered very many sheep and oxen, for him and for the people who had arrived with him. And he persuaded him that he should ascend against Ramoth Gilead. Chronicles : And Ahab, the king of Israel, said to Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, Come with me to Ramoth Gilead. And he answered him: As I am, so also are you. As your people are, so also are my people. And we will be with you in war. Chronicles : And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Consult, I beg you, the word of the Lord for the present circumstances. Chronicles : And so the king of Israel gathered together four hundred men of the prophets, and he said to them: Should we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or should we be quieted? But they said, Ascend, and God will deliver into the hand of the king. Chronicles : And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not a prophet of the Lord here, so that we may inquire of him as well? Chronicles : And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat: There is one man, from whom we would be able to ask the will of the Lord. But I hate him, for he never prophesies good to me, but at all times evil. And it is Micaiah, the son of Imlah. And Jehoshaphat said, You should not speak in this manner, O king. Chronicles : Therefore, the king of Israel called one of the eunuchs, and said to him: Quickly, summon Micaiah, the son of Imlah. Chronicles : Now the king of Israel, and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, were both sitting upon their thrones, clothed in royal vestments. And they were sitting in an open area, beside the gate of Samaria. And all the prophets were prophesying before them. Chronicles : Truly, Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, made for himself horns of iron, and he said: Thus says the Lord: With these, you shall threaten Syria, until you crush it. Chronicles : And all the prophets prophesied similarly, and they said: Ascend against Ramoth Gilead, and you shall prosper, and the Lord will deliver them into the hand of the king. Chronicles : Then the messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah said to him: Lo, the words of all the prophets, with one mouth, announce good to the king. Therefore, I ask you that you not dissent from them in your word, and that you speak prosperity. Chronicles : And Micaiah responded to him, As the Lord lives, whatever my God will say to me, the same shall I speak. Chronicles : Therefore, he went to the king. And the king said to him, Micaiah, should we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or should we be quieted? And he responded to him: Ascend. For everything will come to prosperity, and the enemies will be delivered into your hands. Chronicles : And the king said, Again and again, I bind you by an oath, so that you will not speak to me except what is true in the name of the Lord! Chronicles : Then he said: I saw all of Israel scattered amid the mountains, like sheep without a shepherd. And the Lord said: These have no masters. Let each one return in peace to his own house. Chronicles : And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat: Did I not tell you that this one would not prophesy to me anything good, but only what is evil? Chronicles : Then he said: Therefore, listen to the word of the Lord. I saw the Lord sitting upon his throne, and the entire army of heaven was standing beside him, on the right and on the left. Chronicles : And the Lord said: Who will deceive Ahab, the king of Israel, so that he may ascend and fall at Ramoth Gilead? And when one spoke in one way, and another in another way, Chronicles : there came forward a spirit, and he stood before the Lord and said, I will deceive him. And the Lord said to him, In what way will you deceive him? Chronicles : And he responded, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And the Lord said: You will deceive and prevail. Go forth and do so. Chronicles : Therefore now, behold: the Lord gave a lying spirit to the mouth of all your prophets, and the Lord has spoken evil about you. Chronicles : Then Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, approached, and he struck Micaiah on the jaw, and he said: In what way did the Spirit of the Lord depart from me, so that he would speak to you? Chronicles : And Micaiah said: You yourself shall see it, in that day, when you will enter a room within a room, so that you may be hidden. Chronicles : Then the king of Israel instructed, saying: Take Micaiah, and lead him to Amon, the leader of the city, and to Joash, the son of Amalech. Chronicles : And you shall say: Thus says the king: Send this man to prison, and give to him a little bread and a little water, until I return in peace. Chronicles : And Micaiah said, If you will have returned in peace, the Lord has not spoken by me. And he said, May all the people listen. Chronicles : And so, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, ascended against Ramoth Gilead. Chronicles : And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat: I will change my clothing, and in this way I will go into battle. But you should be clothed in your own garments. And the king of Israel, having changed his clothing, went to war. Chronicles : Now the king of Syria had instructed the commanders of his horsemen, saying, You shall not fight against the least or the greatest, but only against the king of Israel. Chronicles : And so, when the leaders of the horsemen had seen Jehoshaphat, they said, This one is the king of Israel. And while fighting, they surrounded him. But he cried out to the Lord, and he assisted him, and he turned them away from him. Chronicles : For when the commanders of the horsemen had seen that he was not the king of Israel, they left him. Chronicles : Then it happened that one of the people shot an arrow indiscriminately, and it struck the king of Israel between the neck and the shoulder. And so he said to his chariot driver: Turn your hand, and lead me away from the battle line. For I have been wounded. Chronicles : And the fight ended on that day. But the king of Israel was standing in his chariot facing the Syrians, even until evening. And he died when the sun set. Chronicles : Then Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, returned in peace to his house in Jerusalem. Chronicles : And the seer Jehu, the son of Hanani, met him, and said to him: You offer assistance to the impious, and you are joined in friendship with those who hate the Lord. And for this reason, you certainly deserve the wrath of the Lord. Chronicles : But good works have been found in you. For you have taken away the sacred groves from the land of Judah. And you have prepared your heart, so as to seek the Lord, the God of your fathers. Chronicles : Then Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem. And again he went out to the people, from Beersheba as far as mount Ephraim. And he called them back to the Lord, the God of their fathers. Chronicles : And he appointed judges of the land, in all the fortified cities of Judah, in each place. Chronicles : And instructing the judges, he said: Pay attention to what you are doing. For you exercise judgment, not of man, but of the Lord. And whatever you will have judged, it will come back to you. Chronicles : Let the fear of the Lord be with you, and do all things with diligence. For there is no iniquity with the Lord our God, nor respect of persons, nor desire for gifts. Chronicles : Jehoshaphat also appointed Levites and priests and leaders of families, out of Israel, in Jerusalem, so that they might judge the judgment and purpose of the Lord for its inhabitants. Chronicles : And he instructed them, saying, So shall you act: faithfully, in the fear of the Lord, and with a perfect heart. Chronicles : Every case that will come to you from your brothers, who live in their cities, between kindred and kindred, wherever there is a question concerning law, commandment, ceremonies, or justifications, reveal it to them, so that they may not sin against the Lord, and so that wrath may not overwhelm you and your brothers. Then, by acting in this way, you will not sin. Chronicles : But Amariah, a priest and your high priest, shall preside over those things which pertain to God. Then Zebadiah, the son of Ishmael, who is a ruler in the house of Judah, shall be over those works that pertain to the office of the king. And you have before you the Levites as teachers. Be strengthened and act diligently, and the Lord will be with you for what is good. Chronicles : After these things, the sons of Moab, and the sons of Ammon, and with them some from the Ammonites, gathered together so that they might fight against him. Chronicles : And messengers arrived and reported to Jehoshaphat, saying: A great multitude has arrived against you, from those places that are across the sea, and from Syria. And behold, they are standing together at Hazazon-tamar, which is Engedi. Chronicles : Then Jehoshaphat, being terrified with fear, gave himself entirely to petitioning the Lord, and he proclaimed a fast for all of Judah. Chronicles : And Judah gathered together to pray to the Lord. Moreover, everyone from their cities came to beseech him. Chronicles : And when Jehoshaphat had stood up in the midst of the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the Lord, before the new atrium, Chronicles : he said: O Lord, God of our fathers, you are God in heaven, and you rule over all the kingdoms of the Gentiles. In your hand is strength and power, and no one is able to withstand you. Chronicles : Did not you, our God, put to death all the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel? And you gave it to the offspring of your friend Abraham, for all time. Chronicles : And they lived in it. And they built a Sanctuary to your name in it, saying: Chronicles : If evils will have fallen upon us, the sword of judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we will stand in your sight before this house, in which your name is invoked, and we will cry out to you in our tribulations. And you will heed us and accomplish our salvation. Chronicles : Now therefore, behold the sons of Ammon, and of Moab, and mount Seir, through whose lands you did not permit Israel to cross when they were departing from Egypt. Instead, they turned aside from them, and they did not put them to death. Chronicles : They are doing the contrary, and they are striving to cast us from the possession which you delivered to us. Chronicles : Therefore, will you, our God, not judge them? Certainly, in us there is not enough strength so that we would be able to withstand this multitude, which rushes against us. But although we do not know what we ought to do, we have this alone remaining, that we direct our eyes to you. Chronicles : Truly, all of Judah was standing before the Lord with their little ones and wives and children. Chronicles : But there was Jahaziel, the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite from the sons of Asaph, upon whom the Spirit of the Lord went, in the midst of the crowd. Chronicles : And he said: Pay attention, all of Judah, and you who live in Jerusalem, and you, king Jehoshaphat. Thus says the Lord to you: Do not be afraid. Neither should you be dismayed by this multitude. For the fight is not yours, but Gods. Chronicles : Tomorrow, you shall descend against them. For they will ascend along the incline named Ziz, and will find them at the summit of the torrent, which is opposite the wilderness of Jeruel. Chronicles : It will not be you who will fight. Instead, only stand with confidence, and you will see the help of the Lord over you, O Judah and Jerusalem. Do not be afraid. Neither should you be dismayed. Tomorrow you shall go forth against them, and the Lord will be with you. Chronicles : Then Jehoshaphat, and Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell prone on the ground before the Lord, and they adored him. Chronicles : And the Levites from the sons of Kohath, and from the sons of Korah, were praising the Lord, the God of Israel, with a great voice, on high. Chronicles : And when they had risen up in the morning, they went out through the desert of Tekoa. And as they were setting out, Jehoshaphat, standing in their midst, said: Listen to me, men of Judah and all inhabitants of Jerusalem. Believe in the Lord your God, and you will be secure. Believe in his prophets, and everything will come to prosperity. Chronicles : And he gave counsel to the people. And he appointed the singing men of the Lord, so that they would praise him by their companies, and so that they would go before the army, and with one voice say: Confess to the Lord. For his mercy is eternal. Chronicles : And when they had begun to sing praises, the Lord turned their ambushes upon themselves, that is, those of the sons of Ammon, and of Moab, and of mount Seir, who had gone forth so that they might fight against Judah. And they were struck down. Chronicles : For the sons of Ammon and of Moab rose up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, so that they might slay and destroy them. And when they had perpetrated this work, now also turning upon themselves, they cut one another with wounds. Chronicles : Then, when Judah had gone to the high point that looks out toward the desert, they saw, from far away, the entire wide region filled with dead bodies. Neither was there anyone who was left alive and had been able to escape death. Chronicles : Therefore, Jehoshaphat went, and all the people with him, in order to take away the spoils of the dead. And they found, among the dead bodies, diverse equipment, and also garments, and very precious vessels. And they despoiled these, to such an extent that they were unable to carry everything. Neither could they, over three days, take away the spoils because of the magnitude of the plunder. Chronicles : Then, on the fourth day, they were gathered together in the Valley of Blessing. For they had blessed the Lord there, and therefore they called that place the Valley of Blessing, even to the present day. Chronicles : And every man of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, returned, with Jehoshaphat before them, to Jerusalem, with great rejoicing. For the Lord had granted to them gladness concerning their enemies. Chronicles : And they entered into Jerusalem with psalteries, and harps, and trumpets, into the house of the Lord. Chronicles : Then the fear of the Lord fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands, when they had heard that the Lord had fought against the enemies of Israel. Chronicles : And the kingdom of Jehoshaphat was quiet. And God granted to him peace on all sides. Chronicles : And so Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. And he was thirty-five years old when he had begun to reign. Then he reigned for twenty-five years in Jerusalem. And the name of his mother was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi. Chronicles : And he walked in the way of his father, Asa, and he did not decline from it, doing the things that were pleasing before the Lord. Chronicles : Yet truly, he did not take away the high places, and the people still had not directed their heart to the Lord, the God of their fathers. Chronicles : But the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, the first and the last, have been written in the words of Jehu, the son of Hanani, which he digested into the books of the kings of Israel. Chronicles : After these things, Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, formed a friendship with Ahaziah, the king of Israel, whose works were very impious. Chronicles : And he was a partner in the making of ships, which would go to Tarshish. And they made the fleet at Eziongeber. Chronicles : Then Eliezer, the son of Dodavahu, from Mareshah, prophesied to Jehoshaphat, saying: Because you have made a pact with Ahaziah, the Lord has struck your works, and the ships have been broken, and they have not been able to go to Tarshish. Chronicles : Then Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and he was buried with them in the City of David. And his son, Jehoram, reigned in his place. Chronicles : And he had brothers, sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah. All these were sons of Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah. Chronicles : And their father gave to them many gifts of silver, and gold, and valuables, with very fortified cities in Judah. But the kingdom he handed on to Jehoram, because he was the firstborn. Chronicles : Therefore, Jehoram rose up over the kingdom of his father. And when he had established himself, he killed with the sword all his brothers, and certain ones from the leaders of Israel. Chronicles : Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he had begun to reign. And he reigned for eight years in Jerusalem. Chronicles : And he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had done. For his wife was a daughter of Ahab, and he did evil in the sight of the Lord. Chronicles : But the Lord was not willing to destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had formed with him, and because he had promised that he would provide a lamp to him, and to his sons, for all time. Chronicles : In those days, Edom rebelled, so as not to be subject to Judah, and they appointed for themselves a king. Chronicles : And when Jehoram had gone across with his leaders, and all the horsemen who were with him, he arose in the night, and struck the Edomites who had surrounded him, and all the commanders of his horsemen. Chronicles : Even so, Edom rebelled, so as not to be under the authority of Judah, even to this day. Also at that time, Libnah withdrew, so as not to be under his hand. For he had forsaken the Lord, the God of his fathers. Chronicles : Moreover, he also constructed high places in the cities of Judah. And he caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to fornicate, and Judah to prevaricate. Chronicles : Then letters were conveyed to him from the prophet Elijah, in which it was written: Thus says the Lord, the God of David, your father: Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat, your father, nor in the ways of Asa, the king of Judah, Chronicles : but instead you have advanced along the paths of the kings of Israel, and you have caused Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to fornicate, imitating the fornication of the house of Ahab, and moreover, you have killed your brothers, the house of your father, who are better than you: Chronicles : behold, the Lord will strike you with a great plague, with all your people, and your sons and wives, and all your substance. Chronicles : And you shall be sickened by a very grievous disease of your bowels, until your inner organs depart, little by little, each day. Chronicles : Therefore, the Lord stirred up, against Jehoram, the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, who are along the borders of the Ethiopians. Chronicles : And they ascended into the land of Judah. And they laid waste to it. And they despoiled all the substance that was found in the house of the king, including even his sons and wives. Neither did there remain for him any son, except Jehoahaz, who was the youngest born. Chronicles : And in addition to all these things, the Lord struck him with an incurable disease of the bowels. Chronicles : And as day followed after day, and the space of time turned, the course of two years was completed. And after having been wasted by a long consumption, so much so that even his inner organs were discharged, the disease ended along with his life. And so he died of a very grievous illness. And the people did not make a funeral for him, according to the custom of burning, as they had done for his ancestors. Chronicles : He was thirty-two years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for eight years in Jerusalem. And he did not walk uprightly. And they buried him in the City of David, yet truly, not in the sepulcher of the kings. Chronicles : Then the inhabitants of Jerusalem appointed his youngest son, Ahaziah, as king in his place. For the robbers of the Arabians, who had fallen upon the camp, had put to death all those who were greater by birth before him. And so Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram, reigned as king of Judah. Chronicles : Ahaziah was forty-two years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for one year in Jerusalem. And the name of his mother was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri. Chronicles : But he too went forth in the ways of the house of Ahab. For his mother impelled him to act impiously. Chronicles : And so he did evil in the sight of the Lord, just as the house of Ahab did. For after the death of his father, they were counselors to him, to his destruction. Chronicles : And he walked in their counsels. And he went with Joram, the son of Ahab, the king of Israel, to war against Hazael, the king of Syria, at Ramoth Gilead. And the Syrians wounded Joram. Chronicles : And he returned, so that he might be cured at Jezreel. For he had received many wounds in the above-stated battle. And so Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram, the king of Judah, descended, so that he might visit Joram, the son of Ahab, at Jezreel, while he was ill. Chronicles : Indeed, it was the will of God against Ahaziah that he would go to Joram, and when he had gone, that he also would go out with him against Jehu, the son of Nimshi, whom the Lord had anointed to destroy the house of Ahab. Chronicles : Therefore, when Jehu was overthrowing the house of Ahab, he found the leaders of Judah, with the sons of the brothers of Ahaziah, who were ministering to him, and he put them to death. Chronicles : Also, while he himself was seeking Ahaziah, he found him to be hiding in Samaria. And having been led to him, he killed him. And they buried him, because he was the son of Jehoshaphat, who had sought the Lord with all his heart. But there was no longer any hope that someone from the stock of Ahaziah would reign. Chronicles : For indeed, his mother, Athaliah, seeing that her son had died, rose up and killed the entire royal stock of the house of Jehoram. Chronicles : But Jehosheba, the daughter of the king, took Joash, the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from the midst the kings sons when they were being slain. And she hid him with his nurse in a bedroom. Now Jehosheba, the one who had hidden him, was the daughter of king Jehoram, and the wife of the high priest Jehoiada, and the sister of Ahaziah. And because of this, Athaliah did not kill him. Chronicles : Therefore, he was with them, hidden in the house of God, for six years, while Athaliah reigned over the land. Chronicles : Then in the seventh year, Jehoiada having been strengthened, he took the centurions, namely, Azariah, the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael, the son of Jehohanan, and also Azariah, the son of Obed, and Maaseiah, the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat, the son of Zichri, and he formed a pact with them. Chronicles : And traveling through Judah, they gathered together the Levites from all of the cities of Judah, and the leaders of the families of Israel, and they went to Jerusalem. Chronicles : Then the entire multitude formed a pact with the king, in the house of God. And Jehoiada said to them: Behold, the son of the king shall reign, just as the Lord has said concerning the sons of David. Chronicles : Therefore, this is the word that you shall do: Chronicles : One third part of you who arrive on the Sabbath, priests, and Levites, and porters, shall be at the gates. Truly, one third part shall be at the house of the king. And one third shall be at the gate which is called the Foundation. Yet truly, let all the remainder of the common people be in the courts of the house of the Lord. Chronicles : Let no one else enter into the house of the Lord, except the priests, and those from the Levites who are ministering. These alone may enter, for they have been sanctified. And let all the remainder of the common people observe the watches of the Lord. Chronicles : Then let the Levites encircle the king, each one having his weapons. And if anyone else will have entered into the temple, let him be slain. And may they be with the king, both entering and departing. Chronicles : Then the Levites, and all of Judah, acted in accord with all that the high priest Jehoiada had instructed. And each of them took the men who were under him, and who were arriving by the course of the Sabbath, with those who had fulfilled the Sabbath and who were about to depart. For indeed the high priest Jehoiada had not permitted the companies to depart, which were accustomed to replace one another each week. Chronicles : And Jehoiada, the priest, gave to the centurions the lances and round shields and crescent shields of king David, which he had dedicated in the house of the Lord. Chronicles : And he positioned all the people, holding short swords, from the right part of the temple to the left part of the temple, before the altar and the temple, all around the king. Chronicles : And they led out the son of the king. And they imposed the diadem on him, and the testimony. And they gave him the law to hold in his hand. And they appointed him as king. Also, the high priest Jehoiada and his sons anointed him. And they prayed for him, and said, May the king live! Chronicles : And when Athaliah had heard it, specifically the sound of running and the praising of the king, she entered to the people in the temple of the Lord. Chronicles : And when she had seen the king standing upon the step at the entrance, and the leaders and companies around him, and all the people of the land rejoicing, and sounding the trumpets, and playing on instruments of various kinds, and the voice of those who were praising, she tore her garments, and she said: Treason! Treason! Chronicles : Then the high priest Jehoiada, going out to the centurions and to the leaders of the army, said to them: Lead her away, beyond the borders of the temple. And let her be put to death outside, with the sword. And the priest instructed that she should not be killed in the house of the Lord. Chronicles : And they laid hands on her neck. And when she had entered the gate for the horses at the kings house, they put her to death there. Chronicles : Then Jehoiada formed a covenant between himself and the entire people, and the king, so that they would be the people of the Lord. Chronicles : And so, all the people entered into the house of Baal, and they destroyed it. And they broke apart his altars and idols. Also, they put to death Mattan, the priest of Baal, before the altars. Chronicles : Then Jehoiada appointed overseers in the house of the Lord, under the hands of the priests and Levites, whom David had distributed to the house of the Lord so that they might offer holocausts to the Lord, just as it was written in the law of Moses, with gladness and singing, in accord with the disposition of David. Chronicles : Also, he appointed porters at the gates of the house of the Lord, so that whoever was unclean for any reason would not enter. Chronicles : And he took the centurions, and the most valiant men, and the leaders of the people, and all the common people of the land, and they set out to descend to the king, from the house of the Lord, and to enter through the middle of the upper gate, to the house of the king. And they placed him on the royal throne. Chronicles : And all the people of the land were rejoicing, and the city was quieted. But Athaliah was slain with the sword. Chronicles : Joash was seven years old when he had begun to reign. And he reigned for forty years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Zibiah, from Beersheba. Chronicles : And he did what is good before the Lord during all the days of Jehoiada, the priest. Chronicles : Now Jehoiada gave to him two wives, from whom he conceived sons and daughters. Chronicles : After these things, it pleased Joash to repair the house of the Lord. Chronicles : And he gathered together the priests and Levites, and he said to them: Go out to the cities of Judah, and collect from all of Israel money to repair the surfaces of the temple of your God, throughout each year. And do this promptly. But the Levites acted negligently. Chronicles : And the king summoned Jehoiada, the leader, and he said to him: Why was there no concern with you, so that you would compel the Levites to bring, from Judah and from Jerusalem, the money that was appointed by Moses, the servant of the Lord, so as to bring it, from the entire multitude of Israel, to the tabernacle of the testimony? Chronicles : For that very impious woman Athaliah and her sons have destroyed the house of God, and they have adorned the shrine of Baal from all the things that had been sanctified in the temple of the Lord. Chronicles : Therefore, the king instructed, and they made an ark. And they placed it beside the gate of the house of the Lord, on the outside. Chronicles : And they proclaimed, in Judah and Jerusalem, that each one should bring to the Lord the money that Moses, the servant of God, appointed in the desert, concerning all of Israel. Chronicles : And all the leaders and all the people rejoiced. And upon entering, they together took and placed so much into the ark of the Lord that it was filled. Chronicles : And when it was time for them to bring the ark before the king by the hands of the Levites, for they saw that there was much money, the scribe of the king, and the one whom the high priest had appointed, entered. And they poured out the money that was in the ark. Then they carried the ark back to its place. And they did this on each day. And an immense sum of money was gathered. Chronicles : And the king and Jehoiada gave it to those who were in charge of the works of the house of the Lord. Then with it they hired hewers of stone, and artisans of every kind, so that they might repair the house of the Lord, and also so that the works of iron and of brass, which had begun to fall, would be reinforced. Chronicles : And those who were hired were working industriously. And the breach in the walls was healed by their hands. And they returned the house of the Lord to a pristine state. And they caused it stand firm. Chronicles : And when they had completed all the works, they brought the remaining part of the money before the king and Jehoiada. And from it, the vessels of the temple were made, for the ministry and for the holocausts, including bowls and other vessels of gold and silver. And holocausts were being offered in the house of the Lord continually, during all the days of Jehoiada. Chronicles : But Jehoiada was old and full of days. And he died when he was one hundred thirty years old. Chronicles : And they buried him in the City of David, with the kings, because he had done good to Israel and to his house. Chronicles : Then, after Jehoiada passed away, the leaders of Judah entered and reverenced the king. And he was enticed by their obsequiousness, and so he acquiesced to them. Chronicles : And they abandoned the temple of the Lord, the God of their fathers, and they served sacred groves and graven images. And wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem because of this sin. Chronicles : And he sent prophets to them, so that they might return to the Lord. And though they were offering testimony, they were not willing to listen to them. Chronicles : And so the Spirit of God clothed Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada the priest. And he stood in the sight of the people, and he said to them: Thus says the Lord God: Why have you transgressed the precept of the Lord, though it was not to your benefit, and why have you abandoned the Lord, so that he would then abandon you? Chronicles : And gathering together against him, they stoned him, beside the place of the king, in the atrium of the house of the Lord. Chronicles : And king Joash did not remember the mercy with which Jehoiada, his father, had treated him; instead he put to death his son. And as he was dying, he said: May the Lord see and take account. Chronicles : And when a year had turned, the army of Syria ascended against him. And they went to Judah and Jerusalem. And they put to death all the leaders of the people. And they sent all the spoils to the king of Damascus. Chronicles : And although certainly there had arrived a very small number of Syrians, the Lord delivered into their hands an immense multitude. For they had forsaken the Lord, the God of their fathers. Also, against Joash they executed disgraceful judgments. Chronicles : And upon departing, they left him greatly debilitated. Then his servants rose up against him, in vengeance for the blood of the son of Jehoiada the priest. And they killed him on his bed, and he died. And they buried him in the City of David, but not in the sepulchers of the kings. Chronicles : Truly, those who ambushed him were Zabad, the son of an Ammonite woman named Shimeath, and Jehozabad, the son of a Moabite woman named Shimrith. Chronicles : But concerning his sons, and the sum of money that had been amassed under him, and the repairing of the house of God, these things have been written more diligently in the book of kings. Then his son, Amaziah, reigned in his place. Chronicles : Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he had begun to reign. And he reigned for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Jehoaddan, from Jerusalem. Chronicles : And he accomplished good in the sight of the Lord. Yet truly, not with a perfect heart. Chronicles : And when he saw himself to be strengthened in his rule, he cut the throats of the servants who had killed his father, the king. Chronicles : But he did not put to death their sons, just as it was written in the book of the law of Moses, where the Lord instructed, saying: The fathers shall not be slain because of the sons, nor the sons because of their fathers. Instead, each one shall die for his own sin. Chronicles : And then Amaziah gathered together Judah, and he organized them by families, and tribunes, and centurions, throughout all of Judah and Benjamin. And he numbered them from twenty years old and upward. And he found three hundred thousand young men, who could go forth to battle, and who could hold spear and shield. Chronicles : Also, he hired for pay from Israel one hundred thousand experienced men, for one hundred talents of silver. Chronicles : Then a man of God came to him, and he said: O king, let not the army of Israel go forth with you. For the Lord is not with Israel, nor with all the sons of Ephraim. Chronicles : But if you think that a war stands by the strength of the army, God will cause you to be overwhelmed by the enemies. For indeed, it belongs to God to assist, and to put to flight. Chronicles : And Amaziah said to the man of God, Then what will become of the one hundred talents, which I gave to the soldiers of Israel? And the man of God responded to him, The Lord has that from which he is able to give much more than this to you. Chronicles : And so, Amaziah separated the army, which had come to him from Ephraim, so that they would return to their place. But having become very angry against Judah, they returned to their own region. Chronicles : Then Amaziah confidently led forth his people. And he went away to the Valley of the Salt Pits, and he struck down ten thousand of the sons of Seir. Chronicles : And the sons of Judah captured another ten thousand of the men. And they led them to the precipice of a certain rock. And they threw them from the summit, and they were all broken apart. Chronicles : But the army that Amaziah had sent away, so that they would not go with him into battle, spread out among the cities of Judah, from Samaria as far as Beth-horon. And having killed three thousand, they took away much plunder. Chronicles : Truly, after the slaughter of the Edomites, and when the gods of the sons of Seir were brought, Amaziah chose them as gods for himself. And he was adoring them, and burning incense to them. Chronicles : For this reason, the Lord became angry against Amaziah, and he sent a prophet to him, who would say to him, Why have you adored gods who did not free their own people from your hand? Chronicles : And after he spoke these things, he responded to him: Are you the counselor of the king? Be quiet! Otherwise I will put you to death. And departing, the prophet said, I know that God has decided to kill you, because you have done this evil, and also because you have not agreed to my counsel. Chronicles : And so Amaziah, the king of Judah, undertaking a very wicked counsel, sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, the king of Israel, saying: Come, let us see one another. Chronicles : But he sent back messengers, saying: The thistle which is in Lebanon sent to the cedar of Lebanon, saying: Give your daughter to my son as wife. And behold, the beasts that were in the forest of Lebanon passed through, and they trampled the thistle. Chronicles : You said, I struck down Edom. And for this reason, your heart is lifted up with pride. Settle in your own house. Why do you provoke evil against yourself, so that you may fall, and then Judah with you? Chronicles : Amaziah was not willing to listen to him, because it was the will of the Lord that he be delivered into the hands of the enemies, because of the gods of Edom. Chronicles : And so Joash, the king of Israel, ascended, and they presented themselves within the sight of one another. Now Amaziah, the king of Judah, was in Beth-shemesh of Judah. Chronicles : And Judah fell before Israel. And each one fled to his own tent. Chronicles : Then Joash, the king of Israel, captured Amaziah, the king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and he led him to Jerusalem. And he destroyed its walls, from the gate of Ephraim as far as the gate of the corner, four hundred cubits. Chronicles : Also, he brought back to Samaria all the gold and silver, and all the vessels, which he had found in the house of God, and with Obededom in the treasuries of the kings house, as well as sons for hostages. Chronicles : Then Amaziah, the son of Joash, the king of Judah, lived for fifteen years after the death of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the king of Israel. Chronicles : Now the rest of the words of Amaziah, the first and the last, have been written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. Chronicles : And after he withdrew from the Lord, they set up an ambush against him in Jerusalem. But since he had fled into Lachish, they sent and killed him in that place. Chronicles : And having carried him back upon horses, they buried him with his fathers in the City of David. Chronicles : Then all the people of Judah appointed his son, Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, as king in place of his father, Amaziah. Chronicles : He built up Eloth, and he restored it to the dominion of Judah. After this, the king slept with his fathers. Chronicles : Uzziah was sixteen years old when he had begun to reign. And he reigned for fifty-two years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Jecoliah, from Jerusalem. Chronicles : And he did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, in accord with all that his father, Amaziah, had done. Chronicles : And he sought the Lord, during the days of Zechariah, who understood and saw God. And while he was seeking the Lord, he directed him in all things. Chronicles : Indeed, he went out and fought against the Philistines. And he destroyed the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod. Also, he built towns in Ashdod, and among the Philistines. Chronicles : And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians, who were living in Gurbaal, and against the Ammonites. Chronicles : And the Ammonites weighed out gifts to Uzziah. And his name became widely known, even to the entrance of Egypt, because of his frequent victories. Chronicles : And Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem, above the gate of the corner, and above the gate of the valley, and others on the same side of the wall, and he fortified them. Chronicles : Then he also constructed towers in the wilderness, and dug many cisterns, because he had much cattle, both in the plains and in the starkness of the wilderness. Also, he had vineyards and dressers of vines in the mountains and at Carmel. Certainly, he was a man devoted to agriculture. Chronicles : Now the army of his warriors, who would go forth to battle, was under the hand of Jeiel, the scribe, and Maaseiah, the teacher, and under the hand of Hananiah, who was among the kings commanders. Chronicles : And the entire number of the leaders, by the families of strong men, was two thousand six hundred. Chronicles : And the entire army under them was three hundred and seven thousand five hundred, who were fit for war, and who fought on behalf of the king against the adversaries. Chronicles : Also, Uzziah prepared for them, that is, for the entire army, shields, and spears, and helmets, and breastplates, and bows, as well as slings for the casting of stones. Chronicles : And in Jerusalem, he made various kinds of machines, which he placed in the towers, and at the corners of the walls, so as to shoot arrows and large stones. And his name went forth to far away places, for the Lord was helping him and had strengthened him. Chronicles : But when he had become strong, his heart was lifted up, even to his own destruction. And he neglected the Lord his God. And entering into the temple of the Lord, he intended to burn incense upon the altar of incense. Chronicles : And entering immediately after him, Azariah the priest, and with him eighty priests of the Lord, very valiant men, Chronicles : withstood the king, and they said: It is not your office, Uzziah, to burn incense to the Lord; rather, it is the office of the priests, that is, of the sons of Aaron, who have been consecrated for this same ministry. Depart from the sanctuary, otherwise you will be in contempt. For this act will not be reputed to you for your glory by the Lord God. Chronicles : And Uzziah, having become angry, while holding in his hand the censer so that he might burn incense, threatened the priests. And immediately a leprosy arose on his forehead, in the sight of the priests, in the house of the Lord, at the altar of incense. Chronicles : And when the high priest Azariah, and all the rest of the priests, had gazed upon him, they saw the leprosy on his forehead, and they hurried to expel him. Then too, he himself, becoming terrified, rushed to depart, because immediately he had become aware of the wound of the Lord. Chronicles : And so, king Uzziah was a leper, even until the day of his death. And he lived in a separate house, being full of leprosy, because of which he had been ejected from the house of the Lord. Then Jotham, his son, directed the house of the king, and he was judging the people of the land. Chronicles : But the rest of the words of Uzziah, the first and the last, were written by the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz. Chronicles : And Uzziah slept with his fathers. And they buried him in the field of the royal sepulchers, because he was a leper. And Jotham, his son, reigned in his place. Chronicles : Jotham was twenty-five years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok. Chronicles : And he did what was right before the Lord, in accord with all that his father, Uzziah, had done, except that he did not enter into the temple of the Lord, and still the people were transgressing. Chronicles : He improved the high gate of the house of the Lord. And he built many things upon the wall of Ophel. Chronicles : Also, he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and fortresses and towers in the forests. Chronicles : He fought against the king of the sons of Ammon, and he defeated them. And at that time, the sons of Ammon gave to him one hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand cor of wheat, and the same number of cor of barley. These things the sons of Ammon offered to him in the second and third year. Chronicles : And Jotham was strengthened, because he had directed his way before the Lord his God. Chronicles : Now the rest of the words of Jotham, and all his battles and works, have been written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. Chronicles : He was twenty-five years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. Chronicles : And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the City of David. And his son, Ahaz, reigned in his place. Chronicles : Ahaz was twenty years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. He did not do what is right in the sight of the Lord, as his father David did. Chronicles : Instead, he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel. Moreover, he also cast statues for the Baals. Chronicles : It is he who burned incense in the Valley of the son of Hinnom. And he purified his sons by fire, in accord with the ritual of the nations that the Lord put to death at the advent of the sons of Israel. Chronicles : Also, he was sacrificing and burning incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every leafy tree. Chronicles : And so the Lord, his God, delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria, who struck him and took great plunder from his kingdom. And he carried it away to Damascus. Also, he was delivered into the hands of the king of Israel, and he struck him with great affliction. Chronicles : And Pekah, the son of Remaliah, killed, on one day, one hundred twenty thousand, all of them men of war from Judah, because they had forsaken the Lord, the God of their fathers. Chronicles : In the same time, Zichri, a powerful man of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah, the son of the king, and Azrikam, the governor of his house, and also Elkanah, who was second to the king. Chronicles : And the sons of Israel seized, from their brothers, two hundred thousand women, boys, and girls, and immense plunder. And they took it away to Samaria. Chronicles : At that time, there was a prophet of the Lord there, named Oded. And going out to meet the army arriving in Samaria, he said to them: Behold, the Lord, the God of your fathers, having become angry against Judah, has delivered them into your hands. But you have killed them by atrocities, so that your cruelty has reached up to heaven. Chronicles : Moreover, you wanted to subjugate the sons of Judah and Jerusalem as your men and women servants, which is a work that should never be done. And so you sinned in this matter against the Lord your God. Chronicles : But listen to my counsel, and release the captives, whom you have brought from your brothers. For a great fury of the Lord is hanging over you. Chronicles : And so, some of the leaders of the sons of Ephraim, Azariah, the son of Johanan, Berechiah, the son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah, the son of Shallum, and Amasa, the son of Hadlai, stood up against those who were arriving from the battle. Chronicles : And they said to them: You shall not lead back captives to here, lest we sin against the Lord. Why are you willing to add to our sins, and to build upon our old offenses? For indeed, the sin is great, and the furious anger of the Lord is hanging over Israel. Chronicles : And the warriors released the spoils and all that they had seized, in the sight of the leaders and the entire multitude. Chronicles : And the men, whom we mentioned above, rose up and took the captives. All those who were naked, they clothed from the spoils. And when they had clothed them, and had given them shoes, and had refreshed them with food and drink, and had anointed them because of the hardship, and had cared for them, whoever was not able to walk and whoever was feeble in body, they set them upon beasts of burden, and they led them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brothers, and they themselves returned to Samaria. Chronicles : In that time, king Ahaz sent to the king of the Assyrians, requesting assistance. Chronicles : And the Edomites arrived and struck down many of Judah, and they seized great plunder. Chronicles : Also, the Philistines spread out among the cities of the plains, and to the south of Judah. And they seized Beth-shemesh, and Aijalon, and Gederoth, and also Soco, and Timnah, and Gimzo, with their villages, and they lived in them. Chronicles : For the Lord had humbled Judah because of Ahaz, the king of Judah, since he had stripped it of help, and had shown contempt for the Lord. Chronicles : And he led against him Tilgath-pilneser, the king of the Assyrians, who also afflicted him and laid waste to him, without resistance. Chronicles : And so Ahaz, despoiling the house of the Lord, and the house of the kings and the leaders, gave gifts to the king of the Assyrians, and yet it profited him nothing. Chronicles : Moreover, in the time of his anguish, he also added to his contempt against the Lord. King Ahaz himself, by himself, Chronicles : immolated victims to the gods of Damascus, those who had struck him. And he said: The gods of the kings of Syria assist them, and so I will please them with victims, and they will help me. But to the contrary, they had been the ruin of him and of all Israel. Chronicles : And so, Ahaz, having despoiled and broken apart all the vessels of the house of God, closed up the doors of the temple of God, and made for himself altars in all the corners of Jerusalem. Chronicles : Also, he constructed altars in all the cities of Judah, in order to burn frankincense, and so he provoked the Lord, the God of his fathers, to wrath. Chronicles : But the rest of his words, and all his works, the first and the last, have been written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. Chronicles : And Ahaz slept with his fathers. And they buried him in the city of Jerusalem. And they did not allow him to be in the sepulchers of the kings of Israel. And his son, Hezekiah, reigned in his place. Chronicles : And so Hezekiah began to reign when he was twenty-five years old. And he reigned for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah. Chronicles : And he did what was pleasing in the sight of the Lord, in accord with all that his father David had done. Chronicles : In the first year and month of his reign, he opened the double doors of the house of the Lord, and he repaired them. Chronicles : And he brought together the priests and Levites. And he gathered them in the wide eastern street. Chronicles : And he said to them: Listen to me, O Levites, and be sanctified. Cleanse the house of the Lord, the God of your fathers, and take away every uncleanness from the sanctuary. Chronicles : Our fathers sinned and did evil in the sight of the Lord our God, abandoning him. They turned their faces away from the tabernacle of the Lord, and they presented their backs. Chronicles : They closed up the doors which were in the portico, and they extinguished the lamps. And they did not burn incense, and they did not offer holocausts, in the sanctuary of the God of Israel. Chronicles : And so the fury of the Lord was stirred up against Judah and Jerusalem, and he handed them over to turmoil, and to destruction, and to hissing, just as you discern with your own eyes. Chronicles : Lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword. Our sons, and our daughters and wives have been led away as captives because of this wickedness. Chronicles : Now therefore, it is pleasing to me that we should enter into a covenant with the Lord, the God of Israel. And he will turn away the fury of his indignation from us. Chronicles : My sons, do not choose to be negligent. The Lord has chosen you so that you would stand before him, and minister to him, and worship him, and burn incense to him. Chronicles : Therefore, the Levites rose up, Mahath, the son of Amasai, and Joel, the son of Azariah, from the sons of Kohath; then, from the sons of Merari, Kish, the son of Abdi, and Azariah, the son of Jehallelel; and from the sons of Gershon, Joah, the son of Zimmah, and Eden, the son of Joah; Chronicles : and truly, from the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeuel; also, from the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah; Chronicles : indeed also, from the sons of Heman, Jehuel and Shimei; then too, from the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel. Chronicles : And they gathered together their brothers. And they were sanctified. And they entered in accord with the command of the king and the order of the Lord, so that they might expiate the house of God. Chronicles : And the priests, entering the temple of the Lord so that they might sanctify it, took every uncleanness, which they had found inside, out to the vestibule of the house of the Lord; and the Levites took it away and transported it outside, to the torrent Kidron. Chronicles : Now they began to cleanse on the first day of the first month. And on the eighth day of the same month, they entered the portico of the temple of the Lord. And then they expiated the temple over eight days. And on the sixteenth day of the same month, they finished what they had begun. Chronicles : Also, they entered to king Hezekiah, and they said to him: We have sanctified the entire house of the Lord, and the altar of holocaust, and its vessels, indeed also the table of the presence, with all its vessels, Chronicles : and all the equipment of the temple, which king Ahaz, during his reign, had polluted after his transgression. And behold, these have all been set forth before the altar of the Lord. Chronicles : And rising up at first light, king Hezekiah joined as one all the leaders of the city, and they ascended to the house of the Lord. Chronicles : And together they offered seven bulls and seven rams, seven lambs and seven he-goats, for sin, for the kingdom, for the Sanctuary, for Judah. And he spoke to the priests, the sons of Aaron, so that they would offer these upon the altar of the Lord. Chronicles : And so they slaughtered the bulls. And the priests took up the blood, and they poured it upon the altar. Then they also slaughtered the rams, and they poured their blood upon the altar. And they immolated the lambs, and they poured the blood upon the altar. Chronicles : They brought the he-goats for sin before the king and the entire multitude. And they laid their hands upon them. Chronicles : And the priests immolated them, and they sprinkled their blood before the altar, for the expiation of all Israel. For certainly the king had instructed that the holocaust and the sin offering should be made on behalf of all Israel. Chronicles : Also, he situated the Levites in the house of the Lord, with cymbals, and psalteries, and harps, according to the disposition of king David, and of the seer Gad, and of the prophet Nathan. For indeed, this was the precept of the Lord, by the hand of his prophets. Chronicles : And the Levites stood, holding the musical instruments of David, and the priests held the trumpets. Chronicles : And Hezekiah ordered that they should offer holocausts upon the altar. And when the holocausts were being offered, they began to sing praises to the Lord, and to sound the trumpets, and to play various musical instruments, which David, the king of Israel, had prepared. Chronicles : Then the entire crowd was adoring, and the singers and those who were holding the trumpeters were exercising their office, until the holocaust was completed. Chronicles : And when the oblation was finished, the king, and all who were with him, bowed down and adored. Chronicles : And Hezekiah and the rulers instructed the Levites to praise the Lord with the words of David, and of Asaph, the seer. And they praised him with great joy, and kneeling down, they adored. Chronicles : And now Hezekiah also added: You have filled your hands for the Lord. Draw near, and offer victims and praises in the house of the Lord. Therefore, the entire multitude offered victims and praises and holocausts, with devout intention. Chronicles : Now the number of the holocausts that the multitude offered was seventy bulls, one hundred rams, two hundred lambs. Chronicles : And they sanctified to the Lord six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep. Chronicles : Truly, the priests were few; neither were they sufficient to remove the pelts from the holocausts. Therefore, the Levites, their brothers, also assisted them, until the work was completed, and the priests, who were of higher rank, were sanctified. For indeed, the Levites are sanctified with an easier ritual than the priests. Chronicles : Thus, there were very numerous holocausts, with the fat of the peace offerings and the libations of the holocausts. And the service of the house of the Lord was completed. Chronicles : And Hezekiah and all the people were joyful because the ministry of the Lord was accomplished. For certainly, it had pleased them to do this suddenly. Chronicles : Also, Hezekiah sent to all of Israel and Judah. And he wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh, so that they would come to the house of the Lord in Jerusalem, and so that they would keep the Passover to the Lord, the God of Israel. Chronicles : Therefore, having taken counsel, the king and the rulers, and the entire assembly of Jerusalem, resolved that they would keep the Passover, in the second month. Chronicles : For they had not been able to keep it at its proper time. For the priests, who were unable to suffice, had not been sanctified. And the people had not yet been gathered together in Jerusalem. Chronicles : And the word was pleasing to the king, and to the entire multitude. Chronicles : And they resolved that they would send messengers to all of Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, so that they might come and keep the Passover to the Lord, the God of Israel, at Jerusalem. For many had not kept it, just as it was prescribed by the law. Chronicles : And carriers traveled with the letters, by order of the king and his rulers, to all of Israel and Judah, proclaiming, in accord with what the king had ordered: O sons of Israel, return to the Lord, the God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Israel. And he will return to the remnant who escaped from the hand of the king of the Assyrians. Chronicles : Do not choose to be like your fathers and brothers, who withdrew from the Lord, the God of their fathers. And so he delivered them over to destruction, as you yourselves discern. Chronicles : Do not choose to harden your necks, as your fathers did. Surrender to the hands of the Lord. And go to his Sanctuary, which he has sanctified unto eternity. Serve the Lord, the God of your fathers, and the fury of his wrath will be turned away from you. Chronicles : For if you will return to the Lord, your brothers and sons will find mercy before their masters, who led them away as captives, and they will be returned to this land. For the Lord your God is compassionate and lenient, and he will not avert his face from you, if you will return to him. Chronicles : And so, the carriers were traveling quickly from city to city, throughout the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, as far as Zebulun, though they were ridiculing and mocking them. Chronicles : Even so, certain men from Asher, and from Manasseh, and from Zebulun, acquiescing to this counsel, went to Jerusalem. Chronicles : Truly, the hand of God was working in Judah, to give them one heart, so that they would accomplish the word of the Lord, according to the precept of the king and of the rulers. Chronicles : And many people gathered together in Jerusalem, so that they could keep the solemnity of unleavened bread, in the second month. Chronicles : And rising up, they destroyed the altars which were in Jerusalem, and all the things in which incense was burned to idols. Overturning these things, they cast them into the torrent Kidron. Chronicles : Then they immolated the Passover on the fourteenth day of the second month. Also, the priests and Levites, at length having been sanctified, offered the holocausts in the house of the Lord. Chronicles : And they stood in their order, according to the disposition and law of Moses, the man of God. Yet truly, the priests took up the blood, which was to be poured out, from the hands of the Levites, Chronicles : because a great number were not sanctified. And therefore, the Levites immolated the Passover for those who had not been sanctified to the Lord in time. Chronicles : And now a great portion of the people from Ephraim, and Manasseh, and Issachar, and Zebulun, who had not been sanctified, ate the Passover, which is not in accord with what was written. And Hezekiah prayed for them, saying: The good Lord will be forgiving Chronicles : to all who, with their whole heart, seek the Lord, the God of their fathers. And he will not impute it to them, though they have not been sanctified. Chronicles : And the Lord heeded him, and was reconciled to the people. Chronicles : And the sons of Israel who were found at Jerusalem kept the solemnity of unleavened bread for seven days with great rejoicing, praising the Lord throughout each day, with the Levites and the priests, accompanied by the musical instruments corresponding to their office. Chronicles : And Hezekiah spoke to the heart of all the Levites, who had a good understanding concerning the Lord. And they ate during the seven days of the solemnity, immolating victims of peace offerings, and praising the Lord, the God of their fathers. Chronicles : And it pleased the entire multitude that they should celebrate, even for another seven days. And they did this with enormous gladness. Chronicles : For Hezekiah, the king of Judah, had offered to the multitude one thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep. Truly, the rulers had given the people one thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep. Then a great mulititude of priests was sanctified. Chronicles : And the whole multitude of Judah, as much the priests and Levites as the entire crowd that had arrived from Israel, and also the converts from the land of Israel, and those with a habitation in Judah, was overflowing with cheerfulness. Chronicles : And there was a great celebration in Jerusalem, to such an extent as had not been in that city since the days of Solomon, the son of David, the king of Israel. Chronicles : Then the priests and Levites rose up and blessed the people. And their voice was heeded. And their prayer reached the holy habitation of heaven. Chronicles : And when these things had been celebrated according to ritual, all of Israel who had been found in the cities of Judah went forth, and they broke apart the idols and cut down the sacred groves. They demolished the high places and destroyed the altars, not only out of all Judah and Benjamin, but also out of Ephraim as well as Manasseh, until they utterly destroyed them. And all the sons of Israel returned to their possessions and cities. Chronicles : Then Hezekiah appointed the companies of the priests and Levites by their divisions, each man in his proper office, certainly as much for the priests as for the Levites, for the sake of holocausts and peace offerings, so that they might minister and confess and sing, at the gates of the camp of the Lord. Chronicles : Now the portion of the king, from his own substance, was such that they could offer a holocaust always, in morning and in evening, also on the Sabbaths, and the new moons, and the other solemnities, just as it was written in the law of Moses. Chronicles : And now he instructed the people living in Jerusalem that they were to give portions to the priests and Levites, so that they would be able to attend to the law of the Lord. Chronicles : And when this had reached the ears of the multitude, the sons of Israel brought an abundance of first-fruits of grain, wine, and oil, and also honey. And they offered a tenth part of all that the soil brings forth. Chronicles : Then too, the sons of Israel and Judah, who were living in the cities of Judah, brought tithes of oxen and sheep, and tithes of the holy things that they had vowed to the Lord their God. And carrying all these things, they made many stacks. Chronicles : In the third month, they began to lay out the foundations of the stacks. And in the seventh month, they finished them. Chronicles : And when Hezekiah and his rulers had entered, they saw the stacks, and they blessed the Lord and the people of Israel. Chronicles : And Hezekiah questioned the priests and Levites, as to why the stacks were laid out in this way. Chronicles : Azariah, the high priest from the stock of Zadok, answered him, saying: Since the first-fruits began to be offered in the house of the Lord, we have eaten and been satisfied, and much remains. For the Lord has blessed his people. Then what was left over is this great abundance, which you see. Chronicles : And so Hezekiah instructed that they should prepare storage places for the house of the Lord. And when they had done so, Chronicles : they faithfully brought in the first-fruits, as well as the tithes and all that they had vowed. Now the overseer of these things was Conaniah, a Levite; and his brother, Shimei, was second. Chronicles : And after him, there was Jehiel, and Azariah, and Nahath, and Asaahel, and Jerimoth, and also Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, who were overseers under the hands of Conaniah, and his brother, Shimei, by the authority of Hezekiah, the king, and Azariah, the high priest of the house of God, to whom all these things belonged. Chronicles : Yet truly, Kore, the son of Imnah, a Levite and the porter of the eastern gate, was the overseer of the things that were being offered freely to the Lord, and of the first-fruits, and of the things consecrated for the Holy of Holies. Chronicles : And under his charge were Eden, and Benjamin, Jeshua, and Shemaiah, and also Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, so that they would distribute faithfully to their brothers, the small as well as the great, their portions Chronicles : except for the males from three years old and upward for all who were entering the temple of the Lord, and for whatever was needed for the ministry, throughout each day, as well as for the observances according to their divisions. Chronicles : And so, for the priests, by their families, and for the Levites, from the twentieth year and upward, by their orders and companies, Chronicles : and for the entire multitude, as much for the wives as for their children of both sexes, provisions were offered faithfully from whatever had been sanctified. Chronicles : Then too, men were appointed of the sons of Aaron, throughout the fields and the suburbs of each city, who would distribute portions to all the males among the priests and Levites. Chronicles : Therefore, Hezekiah did all these things which we have said in all of Judah. And he worked what is good and upright and true before the Lord his God, Chronicles : for the whole service of the ministry of the house of the Lord, in accord with the law and the ceremonies, desiring to seek his God with his whole heart. And he did so, and he prospered. Chronicles : After these things, and after this manner of truth, Sennacherib, the king of the Assyrians arrived. And entering Judah, he besieged the fortified cities, desiring to seize them. Chronicles : And when Hezekiah had seen this, specifically that Sennacherib had arrived, and that the entire force of the war was turning against Jerusalem, Chronicles : he took counsel with the rulers and with the most valiant men, so that they might obstruct the heads of the springs which were beyond the city. And with everyone discerning the same judgment about this, Chronicles : he gathered together a great multitude, and they obstructed all the springs, and the brook which was flowing through the midst of the land, saying: Otherwise, the kings of the Assyrians might arrive and find an abundance of water. Chronicles : Also, acting industriously, he built up the entire wall that had been broken apart. And he constructed towers upon it, and another wall outside it. And he repaired Millo, in the City of David. And he made all kinds of weapons and shields. Chronicles : And he appointed leaders of the warriors within the army. And he summoned them all to the wide street of the gate of the city. And he spoke to their heart, saying: Chronicles : Act manfully and be strengthened. Do not be afraid. Neither should you dread the king of the Assyrians and the entire multitude that is with him. For many more are with us than with him. Chronicles : For with him is an arm of flesh; with us is the Lord our God, who is our helper, and who fights for us. And the people were strengthened by this type of words from Hezekiah, the king of Judah. Chronicles : After these things, Sennacherib, the king of the Assyrians, sent his servants to Jerusalem, for he and his entire army were besieging Lachish to Hezekiah, the king of Judah, and to all the people who were in the city, saying: Chronicles : Thus says Sennacherib, the king of the Assyrians: In whom do you have faith, as you sit besieged in Jerusalem? Chronicles : Does not Hezekiah deceive you, so that he would deliver you to die from hunger and thirst, by affirming that the Lord your God will free you from the hand of the king of the Assyrians? Chronicles : Is this not the same Hezekiah who destroyed his own high places and altars, and who instructed Judah and Jerusalem, saying: You shall worship before one altar, and you shall burn incense upon it? Chronicles : Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands? Have the gods of the nations and all the lands prevailed so as to free their region from my hand? Chronicles : Who is there, out of all the gods of the nations that my fathers destroyed, who is able to rescue his people from my hand, so that now also your God would be able to rescue you from this hand? Chronicles : Therefore, let not Hezekiah deceive or delude you with vain persuasion. And you should not believe him. For if no god out of all the nations and kingdoms was able to free his people from my hand, and from the hand of my fathers, consequently neither will your God be able to rescue you from my hand. Chronicles : Then too, his servants were speaking many other things against the Lord God, and against his servant Hezekiah. Chronicles : Also, he wrote letters full of blasphemy against the Lord God of Israel. And against him he said: Just as the gods of other nations were unable to free their people from my hand, so also is the God of Hezekiah unable to rescue his people from this hand. Chronicles : Moreover, he also shouted with a great clamor, in the language of the Jews, toward the people who were sitting upon the walls of Jerusalem, so that he might frighten them and so seize the city. Chronicles : And he was speaking against the God of Jerusalem, just as against the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are works of the hands of men. Chronicles : And Hezekiah the king, and Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, prayed against this blasphemy, and they cried out to heaven. Chronicles : And the Lord sent an Angel, who struck all the experienced men and warriors, and the leaders of the army of the king of the Assyrians. And he returned in disgrace to his own land. And when he had entered the house of his god, the sons who had gone forth from his loins killed him with the sword. Chronicles : And the Lord saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib, the king of the Assyrians, and from the hand of all. And he presented to them peace on every side. Chronicles : And now many were bringing victims and sacrifices to the Lord in Jerusalem, and gifts to Hezekiah, the king of Judah. And after these things, he was exalted before all the nations. Chronicles : In those days, Hezekiah was sick, even unto death, and he prayed to the Lord. And he heeded him, and gave to him a sign. Chronicles : But he did not repay according to the benefits which he had received, for his heart was lifted up. And so wrath was brought against him, and against Judah and Jerusalem. Chronicles : And after this, he was humbled, because he had exalted his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And therefore the wrath of the Lord did not overwhelm them in the days of Hezekiah. Chronicles : Now Hezekiah was wealthy and very famous. And he gathered for himself many treasures of silver and gold and precious stones, of aromatics, and all kinds of weapons, and vessels of great price, Chronicles : and also repositories of grain, wine, and oil, and stalls for every beast of burden, and fencing for cattle. Chronicles : And he built for himself cities. For indeed, he had innumerable herds and flocks of sheep. For the Lord had given to him an exceedingly great substance. Chronicles : This same Hezekiah was the one who blocked the upper font of the waters of Gihon, and who diverted them down to the western part of the City of David. In all his works, he prosperously accomplished whatever he willed. Chronicles : Yet still, concerning the legates from the leaders of Babylon, who had been sent to him so that they might inquire about the portent which had happened upon the earth, God permitted him to be tempted, so that everything might be made known which was in his heart. Chronicles : Now the rest of the words of Hezekiah, and his mercies, have been written in the vision of the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amos, and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. Chronicles : And Hezekiah slept with his fathers. And they buried him above the sepulchers of the sons of David. And all of Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, celebrated his funeral. And his son, Manasseh, reigned in his place. Chronicles : Manasseh was twelve years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for fifty-five years in Jerusalem. Chronicles : But he did evil before the Lord, in accord with all the abominations of the nations which the Lord overturned before the sons of Israel. Chronicles : And turning away, he repaired the high places, which had been demolished by his father, Hezekiah. And he constructed altars to the Baals, and made sacred groves. And he adored the entire army of heaven, and he served them. Chronicles : Also, he built altars in the house of the Lord, about which the Lord had said, My name shall be in Jerusalem forever. Chronicles : But he built these for the entire army of heaven, in the two courts of the house of the Lord. Chronicles : And he caused his sons to pass through fire in the Valley of the son of Hinnom. He observed dreams, followed divinations, served the occult arts, had with him magicians and enchanters, and worked many evils before the Lord, so that he provoked him. Chronicles : Also, he set up a graven image and molten statue in the house of God, about which God said to David, and to his son Solomon: In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel, I will place my name forever. Chronicles : And I will not cause the foot of Israel to be moved from the land which I delivered to their fathers. Yet this is so, only if they will take care to do what I have instructed them, by the hand of Moses, with the entire law and the ceremonies and the judgments. Chronicles : And so Manasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that they did evil, more so than all the nations which the Lord had overturned before the face of the sons of Israel. Chronicles : And the Lord spoke to him and to his people, but they were not willing to pay attention. Chronicles : Therefore, he led over them the leaders of the army of the king of the Assyrians. And they captured Manasseh, and they led him, bound with chains and fetters, to Babylon. Chronicles : And after this, being in great anguish, he prayed to the Lord his God. And he did penance greatly before the God of his fathers. Chronicles : And he petitioned and begged him intently. And he heeded his prayer, and led him back to Jerusalem, into his kingdom. And Manasseh realized that the Lord himself was God. Chronicles : After these things, he built a wall outside the City of David, to the west of Gihon, at the steep valley, from the entrance to the fish gate, circling around as far as Ophel. And he raised it up greatly. And he appointed leaders of the army in all the fortified cities of Judah. Chronicles : And he took away the foreign gods, and the idol from the house of the Lord, and also the altars which he had made on the mount of the house of the Lord and in Jerusalem. And he cast all these things outside the city. Chronicles : Then he repaired the altar of the Lord, and he immolated upon it victims, and peace offerings, with praise. And he instructed Judah to serve the Lord, the God of Israel. Chronicles : Yet still the people were immolating on the high places, to the Lord their God. Chronicles : But the rest of the deeds of Manasseh, and his prayer to his God, and also the words of the seers who were speaking to him in the name of the Lord, the God of Israel, are contained in the words of the kings of Israel. Chronicles : Also, his prayer and its heeding, and all his sins and contempt, and the sites on which he built high places and made sacred groves and statues, before he repented, have been written in the words of Hozai. Chronicles : Then Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house. And his son, Amon, reigned in his place. Chronicles : Amon was twenty-two years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for two years in Jerusalem. Chronicles : And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, just as his father Manasseh had done. And he immolated to all the idols that Manasseh had fabricated, and he served them. Chronicles : But he did not turn his face to the Lord, as his father Manasseh had turned himself. And he sinned much more grievously. Chronicles : And when his servants had conspired against him, they killed him in his own house. Chronicles : But the rest of the multitude of the people, having slain those who had struck down Amon, appointed his son, Josiah, as king in his place. Chronicles : Josiah was eight years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for thirty-one years in Jerusalem. Chronicles : And he did what was right in the sight of the Lord, and he walked in the ways of his father David. He did not turn away, neither to the right, nor to the left. Chronicles : Now in the eighth year of his reign, when he was still a boy, he began to seek the God of his father David. And in the twelfth year after he had begun to reign, he cleansed Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the sacred groves, and the idols, and the graven images. Chronicles : And in his sight, they destroyed the altars of the Baals, and they demolished the idols which had been set upon them. And then he cut down the sacred groves and crushed the graven images. And he scattered the fragments upon the tombs of those who had been accustomed to immolate to them. Chronicles : And after that, he burned the bones of the priests upon the altars of the idols. And so did he cleanse Judah and Jerusalem. Chronicles : Then too, in the cities of Manasseh, and of Ephraim, and of Simeon, even to Naphtali, he overturned everything. Chronicles : And when he had destroyed the altars and the sacred groves, and had broken the idols to pieces, and when all the profane shrines had been demolished from the entire land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem. Chronicles : And so, in the eighteenth year of his reign, having now cleansed the land and the temple of the Lord, he sent Shaphan, the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah, the ruler of the city, and Joah, the son of Joahaz, the historian, to repair the house of the Lord his God. Chronicles : And they went to Hilkiah, the high priest. And having accepted from him the money which had been brought into the house of the Lord, and which the Levites and porters had gathered together from Manasseh, and Ephraim, and the entire remnant of Israel, and also from all of Judah, and Benjamin, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Chronicles : they delivered it into the hands of those who were in charge of the workers in the house of the Lord, so that they might repair the temple, and restore whatever was weak. Chronicles : And they gave it to the artisans and the stoneworkers, so that they might buy stones from the quarries, and wood for the joints of the building and for the upper floors the houses, which the kings of Judah had destroyed. Chronicles : And they did everything faithfully. Now the overseers of the workers were Jahath and Obadiah, from the sons of Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam, from the sons of Kohath, who were supervising the work. All were Levites who knew how to play musical instruments. Chronicles : Truly, scribes and teachers, from among the Levites who were porters, were over those who were carrying burdens for various uses. Chronicles : And when they carried out the money that had been brought into the temple of the Lord, Hilkiah the priest found the book of the law of the Lord by the hand of Moses. Chronicles : And he said to Shaphan, the scribe: I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord. And he delivered it to him. Chronicles : Then he took the volume to the king, and he reported to him, saying: Behold, everything that you entrusted to your servants is completed. Chronicles : They have melted together the silver that was found in the house of the Lord. And it has been given to the overseers of the artisans and craftsmen for various works. Chronicles : After this, Hilkiah the priest gave to me this book. And when he had read it in the presence of the king, Chronicles : and he had heard the words of the law, he tore his garments. Chronicles : And he instructed Hilkiah, and Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, and Abdon, the son of Micah, and also Shaphan, the scribe, and Asaiah, the servant of the king, saying: Chronicles : Go, and pray to the Lord for me, and for the remnant of Israel and Judah, concerning all the words of this book, which has been found. For the great fury of the Lord has rained down upon us, because our fathers did not keep the words of the Lord, to do all that has been written in this volume. Chronicles : Therefore, Hilkiah, and those who had been sent with him by the king, went to Huldah, the prophetess, the wife of Shallum, the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, the keeper of the vestments. She was living in Jerusalem, in the second part. And they spoke to her the words which we explained above. Chronicles : And she responded to them: Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Tell the man who sent you to me: Chronicles : Thus says the Lord: Behold, I will lead in evils over this place, and over its inhabitants, with all the curses that have been written in this book, which they have read before the king of Judah. Chronicles : For they have abandoned me, and they have sacrificed to foreign gods, so that they provoked me to wrath by all the works of their hands. Therefore, my fury will rain down upon this place, and it will not be extinguished. Chronicles : To the king of Judah, who sent you to petition before the Lord, so shall you speak: Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Since you listened to the words of this volume, Chronicles : and your heart was softened, and you humbled yourself in the sight of God concerning these things which have been said against this place and against the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and since, revering my face, you have torn your garments, and have wept before me: I also have heeded you, says the Lord. Chronicles : For now I will gather you to your fathers, and you will be brought into your sepulcher in peace. Neither shall your eyes see all the evil that I will lead in, over this place and over its inhabitants. And so they took back to the king all that she had said. Chronicles : And he, calling together all those greater by birth of Judah and Jerusalem, Chronicles : ascended to the house of the Lord, united with all the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the priests and the Levites, and all the people, from the least even to the greatest. And in their hearing, in the house of the Lord, the king read all the words of the volume. Chronicles : And standing up at his tribunal, he struck a covenant before the Lord, so that he would walk after him, and would keep his precepts and testimonies and justifications, with his whole heart and with his whole soul, and so that he would do the things that were written in that volume, which he had read. Chronicles : Also, concerning this, he bound by oath all who had been found in Jerusalem and Benjamin. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem acted in accord with the covenant of the Lord, the God of their fathers. Chronicles : Therefore, Josiah took away all the abominations from all the regions of the sons of Israel. And he caused all who were remaining in Israel to serve the Lord their God. During all his days, they did not withdraw from the Lord, the God of their fathers. Chronicles : Now Josiah kept the Passover to the Lord in Jerusalem, and it was immolated on the fourteenth day of the first month. Chronicles : And he appointed the priests in their offices, and he exhorted them to minister in the house of the Lord. Chronicles : Also, he spoke with the Levites, by whose instruction all of Israel was sanctified to the Lord, saying: Place the ark in the sanctuary of the temple, which Solomon, the son of David, the king of Israel, built. For never again shall you carry it. Instead, now you shall minister to the Lord your God, and to his people Israel. Chronicles : And prepare yourselves by your houses and families, within each division, just as David, the king of Israel, instructed, and just as his son Solomon has written. Chronicles : And minister in the sanctuary, by the Levitical families and companies. Chronicles : And having been sanctified, immolate the Passover. And then prepare your brothers, so that they may be able to act in accord with the words which the Lord has spoken by the hand of Moses. Chronicles : After this, Josiah gave to all the people, those who had been found there at the solemnity of the Passover, thirty thousand lambs and young goats from the flocks, and other kinds of small cattle, and also three thousand oxen. All these were from the substance of the king. Chronicles : Also, his rulers offered what they had vowed freely, as much for the people as for the priests and Levites. Moreover, Hilkiah, and Zechariah, and Jehiel, rulers of the house of the Lord, gave to the priests, in order to observe the Passover, two thousand six hundred small cattle, and three hundred oxen. Chronicles : And Conaniah, with Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brothers, indeed also Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, rulers of the Levites, gave to the rest of the Levites, in order to celebrate the Passover, five thousand small cattle, and five hundred oxen. Chronicles : And the ministry was prepared. And the priests stood in their office, and the Levites also stood in their companies, according to the order of the king. Chronicles : And the Passover was immolated. And the priests sprinkled the blood with their hand, and the Levites drew away the pelts of the holocausts. Chronicles : And they put these aside, so that they might give them to each one, by their houses and families, and so that they might be offered to the Lord, just as it was written in the book of Moses. And with the oxen, they acted similarly. Chronicles : And they roasted the Passover above fire, in accord with what was written in the law. Yet truly, the victims of peace offerings they boiled in cauldrons and kettles and pots. And they promptly distributed these to all the common people. Chronicles : Then afterward, they made preparations for themselves and for the priests. Indeed, the priests had been occupied in the oblations of the holocausts and the fat offerings, even until night. Therefore, the Levites made preparations for themselves and for the priests, the sons of Aaron, last. Chronicles : Now the singers, the sons of Asaph, were standing in their order, according to the instruction of David, and of Asaph and Heman and Jeduthun, the prophets of the king. Truly, the porters kept watch at each gate, so as not to depart from their ministry even for one moment. And for this reason, their brothers, the Levites, prepared foods for them. Chronicles : And so, the entire worship ritual of the Lord was completed on that day, so that they observed the Passover and offered holocausts upon the altar of the Lord, in accord with the precept of king Josiah. Chronicles : And the sons of Israel, who had been found there, kept the Passover at that time, with the solemnity of unleavened bread, for seven days. Chronicles : There was no Passover similar to this one in Israel, from the days of Samuel the prophet. And neither did anyone, out of all the kings of Israel, keep such a Passover as did Josiah, the priests and Levites, and all those of Judah and Israel who had been found, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. Chronicles : In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah, this Passover was celebrated. Chronicles : After Josiah had repaired the temple, Neco, the king of Egypt, ascended to fight at Carchemish, beside the Euphrates. And Josiah went out to meet him. Chronicles : But he sent messengers to him, saying: What is there between me and you, O king of Judah? I have not come against you today. Instead, I am fighting against another house, to which God instructed me to go promptly. Refrain from acting against God, who is with me, otherwise he may kill you. Chronicles : Josiah was not willing to return. Instead, he prepared for war against him. Neither would he agree to the words of Neco from the mouth of God. In truth, he traveled so that he might do battle in the field of Megiddo. Chronicles : And there, having been wounded by archers, he said to his servants: Lead me away from the battle. For I have been severely wounded. Chronicles : And they took him from the chariot, into another chariot which was following him, as was the custom of kings. And they transported him to Jerusalem. And he died, and he was buried in the mausoleum of his fathers. And all of Judah and Jerusalem mourned for him, Chronicles : most of all Jeremiah. All the singing men and women repeat his lamentations over Josiah, even to the present day. And this has become like a law in Israel. Behold, it is found written in the Lamentations. Chronicles : Now the rest of the words of Josiah, and his mercies, which were instructed by the law of the Lord, Chronicles : and also his works, the first and the last, have been written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. Chronicles : Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz, the son of Josiah, and they appointed him king in place of his father, in Jerusalem. Chronicles : Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for three months in Jerusalem. Chronicles : Then the king of Egypt, when he had arrived in Jerusalem, removed him, and condemned the land to one hundred talents of silver and one talent of gold. Chronicles : And he appointed Eliakim, his brother, as king in his place, over Judah and Jerusalem. And he changed his name to Jehoiakim. Truly, he took Jehoahaz with him, and he led him away to Egypt. Chronicles : Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for eleven years in Jerusalem. And he did evil before the Lord his God. Chronicles : Nebuchadnezzar, the king of the Chaldeans, ascended against him, and led him bound in chains to Babylon. Chronicles : And to there, he also took away the vessels of the Lord, and he placed them in his temple. Chronicles : But the rest of the words of Jehoiakim, and his abominations that he worked, and the things that were found in him, are contained in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. Then his son, Jehoiachin, reigned in his place. Chronicles : Jehoiachin was eight years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for three months and ten days in Jerusalem. And he did evil in the sight of the Lord. Chronicles : And when the course of a year had turned, king Nebuchadnezzar sent and brought him to Babylon, carrying away, at the same time, the most precious vessels of the house of the Lord. Truly, he appointed his uncle, Zedekiah, as king over Judah and Jerusalem. Chronicles : Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he had begun to reign. And he reigned for eleven years in Jerusalem. Chronicles : And he did evil in the eyes of the Lord his God. And he did not show remorse before the face of the prophet Jeremiah, who was speaking to him from the mouth of the Lord. Chronicles : Also, he withdrew from king Nebuchadnezzar, who had bound him by an oath to God, and he hardened his own neck and his own heart, so that he did not return to the Lord, the God of Israel. Chronicles : Then too, all the leaders of the priests, with the people, transgressed iniquitously, in accord with all the abominations of the Gentiles. And they polluted the house of the Lord, which he had sanctified to himself in Jerusalem. Chronicles : Then the Lord, the God of their fathers, sent to them, by the hand of his messengers, rising in the night and daily admonishing them. For he was lenient to his people and to his habitation. Chronicles : But they ridiculed the messengers of God, and they gave little weight to his words, and they mocked the prophets, until the fury of the Lord ascended against his people, and there was no remedy. Chronicles : For he led over them the king of the Chaldeans. And he put to death their young men by the sword, in the house of his sanctuary. There was no pity for adolescents, nor virgins, nor the elderly, nor even for the disabled. Instead, he delivered them all into his hands. Chronicles : And all the vessels of the house of Lord, as much the greater as the lesser, and the treasures of the temple, and of the king and the rulers, he carried away to Babylon. Chronicles : The enemies set fire to the house of God, and they destroyed the wall of Jerusalem. They burned down all the towers. And whatever was precious, they demolished. Chronicles : If anyone had escaped from the sword, he was led into Babylon. And he served the king and his sons, until the king of Persia would command, Chronicles : and the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah would be fulfilled, and the land would celebrate her Sabbaths. For during all the days of the desolation, she kept a Sabbath, until the seventy years were completed. Chronicles : Then, in the first year of Cyrus, the king of the Persians, in order to fulfill the word of the Lord, which he had spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah, the Lord stirred up the heart of Cyrus, the king of the Persians, who commanded this to be proclaimed throughout his entire kingdom, and also in writing, saying: Chronicles : Thus says Cyrus, the king of the Persians: The Lord, the God of heaven, has given to me all the kingdoms of the earth. And he has instructed me that I should build for him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judea. Who among you is from his entire people? May the Lord his God be with him, and let him ascend. Paul, a servant of God and an Apostle of Jesus Christ, in accord with the faith of Gods elect and in acknowledgment of the truth which is accompanied by piety, in the hope of the eternal life that God, who does not lie, promised before the ages of time, which, at the proper time, he has manifested by his Word, in the preaching that has been entrusted to me by the command of God our Savior; to Titus, beloved son according to the common faith. Grace and peace, from God the Father and from Christ Jesus our Savior. For this reason, I left you behind in Crete: so that those things which are lacking, you would correct, and so that you would ordain, throughout the communities, priests, just as I also ordained you if such a man is without offense, the husband of one wife, having faithful children, not accused of self-indulgence, nor of insubordination. And a bishop, as a steward of God, must be without offense: not arrogant, not short-tempered, not a drunkard, not violent, not desiring tainted profit, but instead: hospitable, kind, sober, just, holy, chaste, embracing faithful speech which is in agreement with doctrine, so that he may be able to exhort in sound doctrine and to argue against those who contradict. For there are, indeed, many who are disobedient, who speak empty words, and who deceive, especially those who are of the circumcision. These must be reproved, for they subvert entire houses, teaching things which should not be taught, for the favor of shameful gain. A certain one of these, a prophet of their own kind, said: The Cretans are ever liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons. This testimony is true. Because of this, rebuke them sharply, so that they may be sound in the faith, not paying attention to Jewish fables, nor to the rules of men who have turned themselves away from the truth. All things are clean to those who are clean. But to those who are defiled, and to unbelievers, nothing is clean; for both their mind and their conscience have been polluted. They claim that they know God. But, by their own works, they deny him, since they are abominable, and unbelieving, and reprobate, toward every good work. But you are to speak the things that befit sound doctrine. Old men should be sober, chaste, prudent, sound in faith, in love, in patience. Old women, similarly, should be in holy attire, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teaching well, so that they may teach prudence to the young women, so that they may love their husbands, love their children, be sensible, chaste, restrained, have concern for the household, be kind, be subordinate to their husbands: so that the Word of God may be not blasphemed. Exhort young men similarly, so that they may show self-restraint. In all things, present yourself as an example of good works: in doctrine, with integrity, with seriousness, with sound words, irreproachably, so that he who is an opponent may dread that he has nothing evil to say about us. Exhort servants to be submissive to their masters, in all things pleasing, not contradicting, not cheating, but in all things showing good fidelity, so that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things. For the grace of God our Savior has appeared to all men, instructing us to reject impiety and worldly desires, so that we may live soberly and justly and piously in this age, looking forward to the blessed hope and the advent of the glory of the great God and of our Savior Jesus Christ. He gave himself for our sake, so that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and might cleanse for himself an acceptable people, pursuers of good works. Speak and exhort and argue these things with all authority. Let no one despise you. Admonish them to be subordinate to the rulers and authorities, to obey their dictates, to be prepared for every good work, to speak evil of no one, not to be litigious, but to be reserved, displaying all meekness toward all men. For, in times past, we ourselves were also unwise, unbelieving, erring, servants of various desires and pleasures, acting with malice and envy, being hateful and hating one another. But then the kindness and humanity of God our Savior appeared. And he saved us, not by works of justice that we had done, but, in accord with his mercy, by the washing of regeneration and by the renovation of the Holy Spirit, whom he has poured out upon us in abundance, through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that, having been justified by his grace, we may become heirs according to the hope of eternal life. This is a faithful saying. And I want you to confirm these things, so that those who believe in God may take care to excel in good works. These things are good and useful to men. But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, as well as arguments against the law. For these are useless and empty. Avoid a man who is a heretic, after the first and second correction, knowing that one who is like this has been subverted, and that he offends; for he has been condemned by his own judgment. When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, hurry to return to me at Nicopolis. For I have decided to winter there. Send Zenas the lawyer and Apollo ahead with care, and let nothing be lacking to them. But let our men also learn to excel in good works pertaining to the necessities of life, so that they may not be unfruitful. All those who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in the faith. May the grace of God be with you all. Amen. In the eighth month, in the second year of king Darius, the word of the Lord came to Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying: The Lord has become angry over the resentful anger of your fathers. And you shall say to them: Thus says the Lord of hosts: Turn to me, says the Lord of hosts, and I will turn to you, says the Lord of hosts. Do not be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets cried out, saying: Thus says the Lord of hosts: Turn from your evil ways and from your wicked thoughts. But they did not heed, and neither did they pay attention to me, says the Lord. Your fathers, where are they? And will the prophets live unceasingly? Yet truly my words and my lawfulness, which I entrusted to my servants the prophets, were indeed comprehended by your fathers, and so they were converted, and they said: Just as the Lord of hosts decided to do to us, according to our ways and according to our inventions, so has he done to us. On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is called Shevat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying: I saw by night, and behold, a man riding on a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees, which were in the chasm. And behind him were horses: red, speckled, and white. And I said, What are these, my lord? And the angel, who was speaking with me, said to me, I will reveal to you what these are. And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These are they, whom the Lord has sent in order to walk through the earth. And those who stood among the myrtle trees answered the angel of the Lord, and they said, We have walked through the earth, and behold, all the earth is inhabited and is at rest. And the angel of the Lord answered and said, Lord of hosts, how long will you not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, with which you have been angry? This is now the seventieth year. And the Lord answered the angel, who had been speaking with me, good words, consoling words. And the angel, who was speaking with me, said to me: Cry out, saying: Thus says the Lord of hosts: I have been zealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great zeal. And, with a great anger, I am angry with the wealthy nations. Though I had been angry a little, truly they advanced further in evil. Because of this, thus says the Lord: I will be turned back, towards Jerusalem, with mercies; and my house will be built upon this, says the Lord of hosts. And the building line will be extended over Jerusalem. Until then, cry out saying: Thus says the Lord of hosts: Until then, my cities will flow with good things, and, until then, the Lord will comfort Zion, and, until then, he will single out Jerusalem. And I lifted up my eyes, and I saw. And behold: four horns. And I said to the angel, who was speaking with me, What are these? And he said to me, These are the horns that have winnowed Judah and Israel and Jerusalem. And the Lord showed me four workmen. And I said, What have these come to do? He spoke, saying, These are the horns that have winnowed Judah, through every single man, and none of them lifted up his head. And these have come to frighten them away, so as to cast down the horns of the Gentiles, which have lifted up a horn over the land of Judah, so as to scatter it. And I lifted up my eyes, and I saw, and behold, a man, and in his hand was a measuring line. And I said, Where are you going? And he said to me, To measure Jerusalem, so that I may see how great its width and how great its length may be. And behold, the angel, who had been speaking with me, departed, and another angel went out to meet him. And he said to him: Hurry, speak to this young man, saying: Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls, because of the multitude of men and beasts of burden in its midst. And I will be to it, says the Lord, a wall of fire all around. And in glory, I will be in its midst. O, O flee from the land of the North, says the Lord, for I have scattered you into the four winds of heaven, says the Lord. O Zion, flee, you who dwell with the daughter of Babylon. For thus says the Lord of hosts: After the glory, he has sent me to the Gentiles, which have despoiled you. For he who touches you, touches the pupil of my eye. For behold, I lift up my hand over them, and they will be a prey to those who had served them. And you will know that the Lord of hosts has sent me. Sing praise and rejoice, daughter of Zion. For behold, I approach, and I will dwell in your midst, says the Lord. And many nations will be joined to the Lord in that day, and they will be my people, and I will dwell in your midst. And you will know that the Lord of hosts has sent me to you. And the Lord will possess his portion, Judah, in the sanctified land, and still he will single out Jerusalem. Let all flesh be silent before the face of the Lord: for he has arisen from his holy dwelling place. And the Lord revealed to me: Jesus the high priest, standing in the sight of the angel of the Lord. And Satan stood before his right hand, so as to be his adversary. And the Lord said to Satan, May the Lord rebuke you, Satan! And may the Lord, who chose Jerusalem, rebuke you! Are you not a firebrand plucked from the fire? And Jesus was clothed with filthy garments. And he stood before the face of an angel. He answered and spoke to those who stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And he said to him, Behold, I have taken away from you your iniquity, and I have clothed you with a change of clothing. And he said, Place a clean diadem on his head. And they placed a clean diadem on his head, and they clothed him with garments. And the angel of the Lord remained standing. And the angel of the Lord contested with Jesus, saying: Thus says the Lord of hosts: If you will walk in my ways and keep my charge, you likewise will judge my house and will keep my courts, and I will give you some of those who now attend here to walk with you. Listen, Jesus the high priest, you and your friends, who dwell before you, who have been portending to men. For behold, I will lead my servant to the East. For behold, the stone that I have bestowed before Jesus. Upon one stone, there are seven eyes. Behold, I will carve its engraving, says the Lord of hosts. And I will take away the iniquity of that land in one day. On that day, says the Lord of hosts, every man will call his friend from under the vine and from under the fig tree. And the angel who had been speaking with me returned, and he awakened me, like a man who is awakened from his sleep. And he said to me, What do you see? And I said, I looked, and behold, a candlestick entirely in gold, and its lamp was at its top, and seven oil lamps of it were upon it, and there were seven funnels for the oil lamps that were at its top. And there were two olive trees upon it: one to the right of the lamp, and one to its left. And I answered and spoke to the angel who was speaking with me, saying, What are these, my lord? And the angel who was speaking with me answered, and he said to me, Do you not know what these are? And I said, No, my lord. And he answered and spoke to me, saying: This is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel, saying: Not by an army, nor by might, but in my spirit, says the Lord of hosts. What are you, great mountain, in the sight of Zerubbabel? You are among the plains. And he will lead out the primary stone, and he will give equal grace to its grace. And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: The hand of Zerubbabel has founded this house, and his hands will complete it. And you will know that the Lord of hosts has sent me to you. For who has despised the little days? And they will rejoice and will see the silver and lead stone in the hand of Zerubbabel. These are the seven eyes of the Lord, which roam quickly through all the earth. And I responded and said to him, What are these two olive trees to the right of the candlestick, and to its left? And I responded a second time and said to him, What are the two olive branches, which are next to the two golden ridges, in which are the pouring spouts of gold? And he spoke to me, saying, Do you not know what these are? And I said, No, my lord. And he said, These are the two sons of oil, who attend before the Sovereign of all the earth. And I turned and lifted up my eyes. And I saw, and behold, a book flying. And he said to me, What do you see? And I said, I see a book flying. Its length is twenty cubits, and its width is ten cubits. And he said to me, This is the curse that goes forth over the face of the whole earth. For every thief will be judged, just as it has been written there, and everyone who swears by this, will be judged in like manner. I will bring it forth, says the Lord of hosts, and it will approach to the house of the thief, and to the house of him who swears falsely by my name, and it will remain in the midst of his house and will consume it, with its wood and its stones. And the angel had departed, who was speaking with me. And he said to me, Lift up your eyes, and see what this is, that goes forth. And I said, What, then, is it? And he said, This is a container going forth. And he said, This is their eye in all the earth. And behold, a talent of lead was being carried; and behold, one woman sitting in the middle of the container. And he said, This is impiety. And he cast her into the middle of the container, and he sent the weight of lead into its mouth. And I lifted up my eyes and I saw. And behold, two women were departing, and a spirit was in their wings, and they had wings like the wings of a kite, and they lifted up the container between earth and heaven. And I said to the angel who was speaking with me, Where are they taking the container? And he said to me, To a house that may be built for it in the land of Shinar, and so that it may be established and set there upon its own base. And I turned, and I lifted up my eyes and I saw. And behold, four four-horse chariots went out from the middle of two mountains. And the mountains were mountains of brass. In the first chariot were red horses, and in the second chariot were black horses, and in the third chariot were white horses, and in the fourth chariot were speckled horses, and they were strong. And I responded and said to the angel who was speaking with me, What are these, my lord? And the angel answered and said to me, These are the four winds of heaven, which go forth to stand in the presence of the Sovereign of all the earth. The one with the black horses was departing into the land of the North, and the white went forth after them, and the speckled went forth towards the land of the South. Yet those who were the most strong, went out, and sought to go and to roam quickly through all the earth. And he said, Go, walk throughout the earth. And they walked throughout the earth. And he called me and spoke with me, saying, Behold, those who go forth to the land of the North, have quieted my spirit in the land of the North. And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: From those of the captivity, take from Heldai, and from Tobijah, and from Jedaiah. You will approach in that day, and you will go into the house of Josiah, the son of Zephaniah, who came from Babylon. And you will take gold and silver; and you will make crowns, and you will set them on the head of Jesus the son of Jehozadak, the high priest. And you will speak to him, saying: Thus says the Lord of hosts, saying: Behold, a man; the Rising is his name. And under him, he will rise up, and he will build a temple to the Lord. And he will raise a temple to the Lord. And he will carry the glory, and he will sit and rule upon his throne. And he will be a priest upon his throne, and a counsel of peace will be between the two of them. And the crowns will be to Heldai, and Tobijah, and Jedaiah, as well as to Hem, the son of Zephaniah, as a memorial in the temple of the Lord. And those who are far away, will approach, and will build in the temple of the Lord. And you will know that the Lord of hosts sent me to you. Yet this shall be only if, when hearing, you will have heeded the voice of the Lord your God. And it happened, in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word of the Lord came to Zechariah, on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Kislev. And Sharezer and Regemmelech, and the men who were with them, sent to the house of God, to entreat the face of the Lord, to speak to the priests of the house of the Lord of hosts and to the prophets, saying: Must there be weeping with me in the fifth month, and must I sanctify myself, as I have now done for many years? And the word of the Lord of hosts came to me, saying: Speak to all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying: Although you may have fasted and mourned in the fifth and the seventh month for these seventy years, did you indeed keep a fast unto me? And when you did eat and drink, did you not eat for yourselves, and drink only for yourselves? Are not these the words that the Lord has spoken by the hand of the former prophets, when Jerusalem was still inhabited, so that it would prosper, itself and the cities around it, and those inhabitants towards the South and in the plains? And the word of the Lord came to Zechariah, saying: Thus says the Lord of hosts, saying: Judge with true judgment, and act with mercy and compassion, each and every one with his brother. And do not find fault with the widow, and the orphan, and the newcomer, and the poor. And let not a man consider evil in his heart towards his brother. But they were not willing to pay attention, and they turned aside their shoulder to depart, and they pressed upon their ears, so that they would not hear. And they set their heart like the hardest stone, so that they would not hear the law and the words that the Lord of hosts has sent with his Spirit by the hand of the former prophets. And so a great indignation came from Lord of hosts. And it happened, just as he had spoken, and they did not pay attention. So then, they shall cry out, and I will not heed, says the Lord of hosts. And I dispersed them throughout all the kingdoms that they did not know. And the land was left desolate behind them, so that no one was passing through or returning. And they made the desirable land into a deserted place. And the word of the Lord of hosts came, saying: Thus says the Lord of hosts: I have been zealous for Zion with a great zeal, and with a great indignation have I been zealous for her. Thus says the Lord of hosts: I have been turned back towards Zion, and I will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. And Jerusalem will be called: The City of Truth, and The Mountain of the Lord of Hosts, the Sanctified Mountain. Thus says the Lord of hosts: Then elderly men and elderly women will dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man will be with his walking stick in his hand, because of the multitude of days. And the streets of the city will be filled with toddlers and children, playing in its streets. Thus says the Lord of hosts: If it seems difficult in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days, could it indeed be difficult in my eyes, says the Lord of hosts? Thus says the Lord of hosts: Behold, I will save my people from the land of the East, and from the land of the setting of the sun. And I will lead them, and they will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. And they will be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in justice. Thus says the Lord of hosts: Let your hands be strengthened, you who, in those days, are listening to these words by the mouth of the prophets, in the day that the house of the Lord of hosts has been founded, so that the temple may be built. Indeed, before those days, there was no pay for men, nor was there pay for beasts of burden, and neither was there peace for those entering, nor for those exiting, because of the tribulation. And I had dismissed all men, each one against his neighbor. But now, I will not act towards the remnant of this people according to the former days, says the Lord of hosts. But there will be a seed of peace: the vine will give her fruit, and the earth will give her seedlings, and the heavens will give their dew. And I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things. And this shall be: just as you were a curse among the Gentiles, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I save you, and you will be a blessing. Do not be afraid. Let your hands be strengthened. For thus says the Lord of hosts: Just as I intended to afflict you, when your fathers had provoked me to wrath, says the Lord, and I did not show mercy, so have I turned back, thinking in these days to do good to the house of Judah and to Jerusalem. Do not be afraid. Therefore, these are the words that you shall do: Speak the truth, each one to his neighbor. With truth and a judgment of peace, judge at your gates. And let not anyone think up evil against his friend in your hearts. And do not choose to swear falsely. For all these are things that I hate, says the Lord. And the word of the Lord of hosts came to me, saying: Thus says the Lord of hosts: The fast of the fourth, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth will be for the house of Judah in joy and gladness and with bright solemnities. So then, love truth and peace. Thus says the Lord of hosts, then the people may arrive and dwell in many cities, and the inhabitants may hurry, one saying to another: Let us go and entreat the face of the Lord, and let us seek the Lord of hosts. I will go also. And many peoples and strong nations will approach, seeking the Lord of hosts in Jerusalem, and to entreat the face of the Lord. Thus says the Lord of hosts: In those days, then, ten men from every language of the Gentiles will grasp and cling to the hem of one man of Judea, saying: We will go with you. For we have heard that God is with you. The burden of the word of the Lord in the land of Hadrach and its respite in Damascus. For the eye of man and of all the tribes of Israel is of the Lord. Hamath also is at its limits, and Tyre and Sidon. For, of course, they have assumed themselves to be exceedingly wise. And Tyre has built herself a fortress, and she has piled together silver, as if it were soil, and gold, as if it were the mud of the streets. Behold, the Lord will possess her, and he will strike her strength in the sea, and she will be devoured by fire. Ashkelon will see and be afraid. Both Gaza and he will be very sorrowful, as well as Ekron, because her hope has been confounded. And the king will pass away from Gaza, and Ashkelon will not be inhabited. And the divider will sit in Ashdod, and I will scatter the arrogance of the Philistines. And I will take away his blood from his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth, and yet he will be left for our God, and he will be like a governor in Judah, and Ekron will be like a Jebusite. And I will encircle my house with those who serve me in war, going and returning, and the exactor will no longer pass over them. For now I have seen with my eyes. Rejoice well, daughter of Zion, shout for joy, daughter of Jerusalem. Behold, your King will come to you: the Just One, the Savior. He is poor and riding upon a donkey, and upon a colt, the son of a donkey. And I will scatter the four-horse chariot out of Ephraim and the horse from Jerusalem, and the bow of war will be destroyed. And he will speak peace to the Gentiles, and his power will be from sea to sea, and from the rivers even to the end of the earth. You, likewise, by the blood of your testimony, have sent forth your prisoners from the pit, in which there is no water. Turn back to the fortress, prisoners of hope. Today, I also announce that I will repay you double, because I have stretched out Judah for myself, like a bow; I have filled Ephraim. And I will raise up your sons, Zion, above your sons, Greece. And I will set you as the sword of the strength. And the Lord God will be seen over them, and his arrow will go forth like lightning. And the Lord God will sound the trumpet, and he will go forth into the whirlwind of the South. The Lord of hosts will protect them. And they will devour and subdue with the stones of the sling. And, when drinking, they will become inebriated, as if with wine, and they will be filled like bowls and like the horns of the altar. And in that day, the Lord their God will save them as the flock of his people. For holy stones will be lifted up over his land. For what is his goodness and what is his beauty, other than grain among the elect and wine springing forth virgins? Petition before the Lord for rain in the latter time, and the Lord will produce snows and will give showers of rain to them, to each blade in the field. For the images have been speaking what is useless, and the diviners have seen a lie, and the dreamers have been speaking false hope: they have comforted in vain. For this reason, they have been led away like a flock; they will be afflicted, because they have no shepherd. My fury has been kindled over the shepherds, and I will visit upon the he-goats. For the Lord of hosts has visited his flock, the house of Judah, and he has set them like the horse of his glory in the war. From him will go forth the angle, from him the wooden peg, from him the bow of battle, from him every exactor at the same time. And they will be like the strong, trampling the mud of the ways in battle. And they will fight, for the Lord is with them. And the riders of the horses will be confounded. And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will convert them, because I will have mercy on them. And they will be as they were when I had not cast them away. For I am the Lord their God, and I will hear them. And they will be like the strong of Ephraim, and their heart will rejoice as if by wine, and their sons will see and will rejoice, and their heart will exult in the Lord. I will whistle for them, and I will gather them together, because I have redeemed them. And I will multiply them, as they had been multiplied before. And I will sow them among the peoples, and from far away they will remember me. And they will live with their sons, and they will return. And I will lead them back from the land of Egypt, and I will gather them from among the Assyrians, and I will lead them to the land of Gilead and Lebanon, and no place will be left that has not been found by them. And he will pass over the narrow passage of the sea, and he will strike the waves of the sea, and all the depths of the river will be confounded, and the arrogance of Assyria will be brought low, and the scepter of Egypt will withdraw. I will strengthen them in the Lord, and they will walk in his name, says the Lord. Open your gates, Lebanon, and let fire consume your cedars. Howl, you fir tree, for the cedar has fallen, because the magnificent have been devastated. Howl, you oaks of Bashan, because the secure forest passage has been cut down. The voice of the howling of the shepherds: for their magnificence has been devastated. The voice of the roaring of the lions: because the arrogance of the Jordan has been devastated. Thus says the Lord my God: Feed the flock of the slaughter, which those who possessed them cut down, and they did not feel sorrow, and they sold them, saying: Blessed be the Lord; we have become wealthy. Even their shepherds did not spare them. And so, I will no longer spare the inhabitants upon the earth, says the Lord. Behold, I will deliver men, each one into the hand of his neighbor and into the hand of his king. And they will cut down the land, and I will not rescue it from their hand. And I will pasture the flock of the slaughter, because of this, O poor of the flock. And I took to myself two staffs: the one I called Handsome, and the other I called Rope, and I pastured the flock. And I cut down three shepherds in one month. And my soul became contracted concerning them, just as their soul also varied concerning me. And I said: I will not pasture you. Whatever dies, let it die. And whatever is cut down, let it be cut down. And let the rest of them devour, each one the flesh of his neighbor. And I took my staff, which was called Handsome, and I tore it apart, so as to invalidate my pact, which I had struck with all of the people. And it became invalid in that day. And so they understood, just like the poor of the flock who stay close to me, that this is the word of the Lord. And I said to them: If it is good in your eyes, bring me my wages. And if not, remain still. And they weighed for my wages thirty silver coins. And the Lord said to me: Cast it towards the statuary, the handsome price at which I have been valued by them. And I took the thirty silver coins, and I cast them into the house of the Lord, towards the statuary. And I cut short my second staff, which was called Rope, so that I might dissolve the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. And the Lord said to me: Still they are to you the equipment of a foolish shepherd. For behold, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, who will not visit what is forsaken, nor seek what is scattered, nor heal what is broken, nor nourish what remains standing, and he will consume the flesh of the fatted ones and break their hoofs. O shepherd and idol, abandoning the flock, with a sword upon his arm and over his right eye: his arm will be withered by drought, and his right eye will be obscured by darkness. The burden of the word of the Lord upon Israel. The Lord, stretching forth the heavens and founding the earth and forming the spirit of man within him, says: Behold, I will set Jerusalem as a lintel of the effects of drunkenness to all the surrounding peoples, yet even Judah will be in the blockade against Jerusalem. And this shall be: In that day, I will set Jerusalem as a burdensome stone to every people. All who will lift it up will be torn to pieces. And all the kingdoms of the earth will be gathered together against her. In that day, says the Lord, I will strike every horse with stupor and his rider with madness. And I will open my eyes upon the house of Judah, and I will strike every horse of the people with blindness. And the governors of Judah will say in their heart, Let the inhabitants of Jerusalem be strengthened for me, in the Lord of hosts, their God. In that day, I will set the governors of Judah like a flaming furnace among wood, and like a flaming torch among hay. And they will devour, to the right and to the left, all the surrounding peoples. And Jerusalem will be inhabited again, in her own place, in Jerusalem. And the Lord will save the tabernacles of Judah, just as in the beginning, so that the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem may not glorify themselves boastfully against Judah. In that day, the Lord will protect the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and even he who will have offended from them, in that day, will be like David, and the house of David will be like that of God, just like an angel of the Lord in their sight. And this shall be in that day: I will seek to crush all the Gentiles that come against Jerusalem. And I will pour out upon the house of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of prayers. And they will look upon me, whom they have pierced, and they will mourn for him as one mourns for an only son, and they will feel sorrow over him, as one would be sorrowful at the death of a firstborn. In that day, there will be a great lamentation in Jerusalem, like the lamentation of Hadadrimmon in the plain of Megiddo. And the earth will mourn: families and families separately; the families of the house of David separately, and their women separately; the families of the house of Nathan separately, and their women separately; the families of the house of Levi separately, and their women separately; the families of Shimei separately, and their women separately; all the rest of the families, families and families separately, and their women separately. In that day, there will be a fountain open to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for the washing of the transgressor and of the defiled woman. And this shall be in that day, says the Lord of hosts: I will disperse the names of the idols from the earth, and they will not be remembered any longer. And I will take away the false prophets and the unclean spirit from the earth. And this shall be: when any devotee will continue to prophesy, his father and his mother, who conceived him, will say to him, You shall not live, because you have been speaking a lie in the name of the Lord. And his father and his mother, his own parents, will pierce him, when he will prophesy. And this shall be: In that day, the prophets will be confounded, each one by his own vision, when he will prophesy. Neither will they be covered with a garment of sackcloth in order to deceive. But he will say, I am not a prophet; I am a man of agriculture. For Adam has been my example from my youth. And they will say to him, What are these wounds in the middle of your hands? And he will say, I was wounded with these in the house of those who love me. Awake, O spear, against my shepherd and against the man that clings to me, says the Lord of hosts. Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered. And I will turn my hand to the little ones. And there will be in all the earth, says the Lord, two parts in it will be scattered and will pass away, and the third part will be left behind. And I will lead the third part through fire, and I will burn them just as silver is burned, and I will test them just as gold is tested. They will call on my name, and I will heed them. I will say, You are my people. And they will say, The Lord is my God. Behold, the days of the Lord will arrive, and your spoils will be divided in your midst. And I will gather all the Gentiles in battle against Jerusalem, and the city will be captured, and the houses will be ravaged, and the women will be violated. And the central part of the city will go forth into captivity, and the remainder of the people will not be taken away from the city. Then the Lord will go forth, and he will fight against those Gentiles, just as when he fought in the day of conflict. And his feet will stand firm, in that day, upon the Mount of Olives, which is opposite Jerusalem towards the East. And the mount of Olives will be divided down its center part, towards the East and towards the West, with a very great rupture, and the center of the mountain will be separated towards the North, and its center towards the Meridian. And you will flee to the valley of those mountains, because the valley of the mountains will be joined all the way to the next. And you will flee, just as you fled from the face of the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. And the Lord my God will arrive, and all the saints with him. And this shall be in that day: there will not be light, only cold and frost. And there will be one day, which is known to the Lord, not day and not night. And in the time of the evening, there will be light. And this shall be in that day: the living waters will go out from Jerusalem, half of them towards the East sea, and half of them towards the furthest sea. They will be in summer and in winter. And the Lord will be King over all the earth. In that day, there will be one Lord, and his name will be one. And all the land will return even to the desert, from the hill of Rimmon to the South of Jerusalem. And she will be exalted, and she will dwell in her own place, from the gate of Benjamin even to the place of the former gate, and even to the gate of the corners, and from the tower of Hananel even to the pressing room of the king. And they will dwell in it, and there will be no further anathema, but Jerusalem shall sit securely. And this will be the plague by which the Lord will strike all the Gentiles that have fought against Jerusalem. The flesh of each one will waste away while they are standing on their feet, and their eyes will be consumed in their sockets, and their tongue will be consumed in their mouth. In that day, there will be a great tumult from the Lord among them. And a man will take the hand of his neighbor, and his hand will be clasped upon the hand of his neighbor. And even Judah will fight against Jerusalem. And the riches of all the Gentiles will be gathered together around them: gold, and silver, and more than enough garments. And, like the ruin of the horse, and the mule, and the camel, and the donkey, and all the beasts of burden, which will have been in those encampments, so will be this ruination. And all those who will be the remnant of all the Gentiles that came against Jerusalem, will go up, from year to year, to adore the King, the Lord of hosts, and to celebrate the feast of tabernacles. And this shall be: whoever will not go up, from the families of the earth to Jerusalem, so as to adore the King, the Lord of hosts, there will be no showers upon them. But if even the family of Egypt will go not up, nor approach, neither will it be upon them, but there will be ruin, by which the Lord will strike all the Gentiles, who will not go up to celebrate the feast of tabernacles. This will be the sin of Egypt, and this will be the sin of all the Gentiles, who will not go up to celebrate the feast of tabernacles. In that day, that which is on the bridle of the horse will be holy to the Lord. And even the cooking pots in the house of the Lord will be like holy vessels before the altar. And every cooking pot in Jerusalem and Judah will be sanctified to the Lord of hosts. And all those who make sacrifices will come and take from them, and will cook with them. And the merchant will no longer be in the house of the Lord of hosts, in that day. The word of the Lord that came to Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah. While gathering, I will gather together all things from the face of the earth, says the Lord. I will gather man and cattle; I will gather the flying things of the air and the fish of the sea. And the impious will be a catastrophe. And I will disperse men before the face of the earth, says the Lord. And I will extend my hand over Judah and over all the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And I will disperse from this place the remnant of Baal, and the names of the administrators along with the priests, and those who adore the military campaign over the ceiling of the sky, both those who adore and swear by the Lord, and those who swear by Melchom, both those who turn aside from following after the Lord, and those who have not sought the Lord, nor inquired about him. Be silent before the face of the Lord God. For the day of the Lord is near; for the Lord has prepared a victim, he has sanctified those he has called. And this shall be: in the day of the victim of the Lord, I will visit upon the leaders, and upon the sons of the king, and upon all who have been clothed with strange garments. And I will visit upon all who enter arrogantly over the threshold in that day, those who fill the house of the Lord their God with iniquity and deceit. And this shall be in that day, says the Lord: the voice of an outcry from the fish gate, and a howling from the Second, and a great contrition from the hills. Howl, inhabitants of the Pillar. All the people of Canaan have fallen silent. All were ruined who had been wrapped in silver. And this shall be in that time: I will scrutinize Jerusalem with lamps, and I will visit upon the men who have become stuck in the dregs, who say in their hearts, The Lord will not do good, and he will not do evil. And their strength will be in plundering, and their houses in the desert. And they will build houses and not dwell in them, and they will plant vineyards and not drink their wine. The great day of the Lord is near; it is near and exceedingly swift. The voice of the day of the Lord is bitter; the strong will be tested there. That day is a day of wrath, a day of tribulation and anguish, a day of calamity and misery, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and whirlwinds, a day of the trumpet and the trumpet blast over fortified cities and over exalted ramparts. And I will trouble men, and they will walk like the blind, because they have sinned against the Lord. And their blood will be poured out like soil, and their bodies like manure. Neither their silver, nor their gold, will be able to free them in the day of the wrath of the Lord. All the land will be devoured in the fire of his zeal, for with all speed, he will bring to consummation every inhabitant of the land. Assemble, be gathered together, O people not worthy to be loved. Until the decree settles accounts, the day like dust is passing away, before which the wrath of the fury of the Lord may overcome you, before which the day of the anger of the Lord may overcome you. Seek the Lord, all you meek of the earth; you who have been working are his judgment. Seek the just, seek the meek. So then, in some way, you might be hidden in the day of the fury of the Lord. For Gaza will be destroyed, and Ashkelon will be in the desert; they will expel Ashdod at midday, and Ekron will be eradicated. Woe to you who inhabit the coast of the sea, you people of perdition. The word of the Lord is over you, Canaan, the land of the Philistines, and I will disperse you, so that not one inhabitant will be left. And the coastline of the sea will be a resting place for shepherds and a fence line for cattle. And it will be the line of him who will remain from the house of Judah. There they will pasture. In the houses of Ashkelon, they will rest towards evening. For the Lord their God will visit them, and he will turn away their captivity. I have heard about the disgrace of Moab and the blasphemies of the sons of Ammon, by which they have defamed my people and have been magnified beyond their borders. Because of this, as I live, says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Moab will be like Sodom, and the sons of Ammon like Gomorrah, like the dryness of thorns, and piles of salt, and a desert, all the way to eternity. The remnant of my people will despoil them, and the residue of my nation will possess them. This will come upon them for their arrogance, because they have blasphemed and have been magnified over the people of the Lord of hosts. The Lord will be a horror over them, and he will reduce all the gods of the earth. And they will adore him, each man from his own place, all the islands of the Gentiles. Even so, you Ethiopians, you will be executed by my sword. And he will extend his hand over the North, and he will destroy Assur. And he will set the Beautiful in the wilderness, and in an impassable place, and like a desert. And flocks will lie down in its midst, all the beasts of the Gentiles. And the pelican and the hedgehog will stay at its threshold; the voice of the singing bird will be at the window, with the crow above its threshold, for I will diminish her strength. This is the glorious city, dwelling in trust, which said in her heart, I am and there is no one other than me. How has she become a lair for beasts in the desert? All who pass through her will hiss and wag their hand. Woe to the provocatrix and the redeemed city, the dove. She has not heeded the voice, nor has she accepted discipline. She has not trusted in the Lord; she did not draw near to her God. Her leaders are in her midst like roaring lions. Her judges are evening wolves; they leave nothing for the morning. Her prophets are crazed; men without faith. Her priests have polluted what is holy; they have acted unjustly against the law. The just Lord is in their midst; he will not do iniquity. In the morning, in the morning, he will bring his judgment into the light, and it will not be hidden. But the impious one has not known shame. I have dispersed the nations, and their towers have been torn down. I have made their ways deserts, until there were none who passed through. Their cities have become desolate, with no man remaining, nor any inhabitant. I said: Nevertheless, you will fear me; you will accept discipline. And her dwelling place will not perish, despite all the things about which I have visited her. Yet truly, they arose with the dawn and corrupted all their thoughts. Because of this, expect me, says the Lord, in the day of my resurrection in the future, for my judgment is to gather together the Gentiles, and to collect the kingdoms, and to pour out over them my indignation, all the fury of my anger. For by the fire of my zeal, all the earth will be devoured. For then I will restore to the people a chosen lip, so that all may invoke the name of the Lord and may serve him with one shoulder. From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia, my supplicants, the sons of my diaspora, will carry a gift to me. In that day, you will not be ashamed over all of your inventions, by which you have transgressed against me. For then I will take away from your midst your arrogant boasters, and you will no longer be exalted on my holy mountain. And I will bequeath into your midst a poor and needy people, and they will hope in the name of the Lord. The remnant of Israel will not do iniquity, nor speak lies, and a deceitful tongue will not be found in their mouth. For they will pasture and will recline, and there will be no one to strike them with terror. Give praise, daughter of Zion. Shout joyfully, Israel. Rejoice and exult with all your heart, daughter of Jerusalem. The Lord has taken away your judgment; he has turned aside your foes. The king of Israel, the Lord, is in your midst; you shall no longer fear evil. In that day, it will be said to Jerusalem, Do not be afraid, and to Zion, Do not let your hands be weakened. The Lord your God is the strength in your midst; he will save. He will rejoice over you with gladness. In his love, he will be silent. He will exult over you with praise. The triflers who withdrew from the law, I will gather together, because they were from you, so that you may no longer suffer disgrace over them. Behold, I will execute all who have afflicted you in that time, and I will save those who are lame, and I will gather together her who had been cast out. And I will place them in praise and in renown, in all the land where they had been put to shame, in that time, when I will lead to you, and in the time when I will gather for you. For I will deliver you into renown and into praise, among all the peoples of the earth, when I will have converted your captivity before your very eyes, says the Lord.
