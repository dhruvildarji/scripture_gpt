no longer came into the land of Israel.
2 Kings 6:24	Now it happened that, after these things, Benhadad, the king of Syria, gathered together his entire army, and he ascended and was besieging Samaria.
2 Kings 6:25	And a great famine occurred in Samaria. And it was blockaded for a long time, until the head of a donkey was sold for eighty pieces of silver, and one fourth part of a pint of pigeons’ dung sold for five silver coins.
2 Kings 6:26	And as the king of Israel was passing by the wall, a certain woman cried out to him, saying, “Save me, my lord the king!”
2 Kings 6:27	And he said: “If the Lord does not save you, how am I able to save you? From the grain floor, or from the wine press?” And the king said to her, “What is the matter with you?” And she responded:
2 Kings 6:28	“This woman said to me: ‘Give your son, so that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.’
2 Kings 6:29	Therefore, we cooked my son, and we ate him. And I said to her on the next day, ‘Give your son, so that we may eat him.’ But she concealed her son.”
2 Kings 6:30	When the king had heard this, he tore his garments, and he passed along the wall. And all the people saw the haircloth that he had worn underneath, beside his flesh.
2 Kings 6:31	And the king said, “May God do these things to me, and may he add these other things, if the head of Elisha, the son of Shaphat, will remain on him this day!”
2 Kings 6:32	Now Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. And so he sent a man ahead. And before that messenger arrived, he said to the elders: “Do you not know that this son of a murderer is sending someone to cut off my head? Therefore, watch, and when the messenger arrives, close the door. And you shall not permit him to enter. For behold, the sound of his lord’s feet is behind him.”
2 Kings 6:33	While he was still speaking to them, the messenger appeared who was sent to him. And he said: “Behold, such a great evil is from the Lord! What more should I expect from the Lord?”
2 Kings 7:1	Then Elisha said: “Listen to the word of the Lord. Thus says the Lord: Tomorrow, at this time, one measure of fine wheat flour will be one silver coin, and two measures of barley will be one silver coin, at the gate of Samaria.”
2 Kings 7:2	And one of the leaders, upon whose hand the king leaned, responding to the man of God, said, “Even if the Lord will open the floodgates of heaven, how can what you say possibly be?” And he said, “You will see it with your own eyes, and you will not eat from it.”
2 Kings 7:3	Now there were four lepers beside the entrance of the gate. And they said one to another: “Should we choose to stay here until we die?
2 Kings 7:4	If we choose to enter the city, we will die from the famine. And if we remain here, we also will die. Therefore, come and let us flee over to the camp of the Syrians. If they spare us, we will live. But if they choose to kill us, we will die anyway.”
2 Kings 7:5	Therefore, they rose up in the evening, so that they might go to the camp of the Syrians. And when they had arrived at the beginning of the camp of the Syrians, they found no one in that place.
2 Kings 7:6	For indeed, the Lord had caused them to hear, in the camp of Syria, the sound of chariots and horses, and a very numerous army. And they said one to another: “Behold, the king of Israel has paid wages to the kings of the Hittites and of the Egyptians against us. And they will overwhelm us.”
2 Kings 7:7	Therefore, they rose up and fled away in the dark. And they left behind their tents and horses and donkeys in the camp. And they fled, desiring to save so much as their own lives.
2 Kings 7:8	And so, when these lepers had arrived at the beginning of the camp, they entered one tent, and they ate and drank. And they took from there silver, and gold, and clothing. And they went away and hid it. And they returned again to another tent, and similarly, carrying away from there, they hid it.
2 Kings 7:9	Then they said one to another: “We are not doing the right thing. For this is a day of good news. If we remain silent and refuse to report it until morning, we will be charged with a crime. Come, let us go and report it in the court of the king.”
2 Kings 7:10	And when they had arrived at the gate of the city, they explained to them, saying: “We went into the camp of the Syrians, and we found no one in that place, except horses and donkeys tied, and the tents still standing.”
2 Kings 7:11	Therefore, the gatekeepers went and reported it in the palace of the king.
2 Kings 7:12	And he rose up in the night, and he said to his servants: “I tell you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are suffering from famine, and therefore they have gone out from the camp, and they lie hidden in the fields, saying: ‘When they will have gone out from the city, we will capture them alive, and then we will be able to enter the city.’ ”
2 Kings 7:13	But one of his servants responded: “Let us take the five horses that remain in the city (for there were no more amid the entire multitude of Israel, since the rest had been consumed), and sending, we will be able to explore.”
2 Kings 7:14	Therefore, they brought two horses. And the king sent them into the camp of the Syrians, saying, “Go, and see.”
2 Kings 7:15	And they went away after them, as far as the Jordan. But behold, the entire way was filled with clothing and vessels, which the Syrians had thrown aside when they were disturbed. And the messengers returned and told the king.
2 Kings 7:16	And the people, going out, pillaged the camp of the Syrians. And one measure of fine wheat flour went for one silver coin, and two measures of barley went for one silver coin, in accord with the word of the Lord.
2 Kings 7:17	Then the king stationed that leader, on whose hand he leaned, at the gate. And the crowd trampled him at the entrance of the gate. And he died, in accord with what the man of God had said when the king had descended to him.
2 Kings 7:18	And this happened in accord with the word of the man of God, which he had spoken to the king, when he said: “Two measures of barley will be one silver coin, and one measure of fine wheat flour will be one silver coin, at this same time tomorrow, at the gate of Samaria.”
2 Kings 7:19	Then that leader had responded to the man of God, and he had said, “Even if the Lord will open the floodgates of heaven, how can what you say possibly happen?” And he said to him, “You will see it with your own eyes, and you will not eat from it.”
2 Kings 7:20	Therefore, it happened to him just as it had been predicted. For the people trampled him at the gate, and he died.
2 Kings 8:1	Now Elisha spoke to the woman, whose son he had caused to live, saying: “Rise up. Go, you and your household, and sojourn in whatever place you can find. For the Lord has called forth a famine, and it shall overwhelm the land for seven years.”
2 Kings 8:2	And she rose up, and she acted in accord with the word of the man of God. And going with her household, she sojourned in the land of the Philistines for many days.
2 Kings 8:3	And when the seven years had ended, the woman returned from the land of the Philistines. And she departed, so that she might petition the king on behalf of her house and on behalf of her fields.
2 Kings 8:4	Now the king was speaking with Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, saying, “Describe for me all the great deeds that Elisha has done.”
2 Kings 8:5	And as he was describing for the king the manner in which he had raised the dead, the woman appeared, whose son he had restored to life, crying out to the king on behalf of her house and on behalf of her fields. And Gehazi said, “My lord the king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha raised up.”
2 Kings 8:6	And the king questioned the woman. And she explained it to him. And the king appointed a eunuch to her, saying, “Restore to her all that is hers, with all the proceeds of the fields, from the day that she left the land until the present.”
2 Kings 8:7	Also, Elisha arrived in Damascus, and Benhadad, the king of Syria, was ill. And they reported to him, saying, “The man of God has arrived here.”
2 Kings 8:8	And the king said to Hazael: “Take with you gifts. And go to meet the man of God. And consult the Lord through him, saying: ‘Will I be able to escape from this, my infirmity?’ ”
2 Kings 8:9	And so, Hazael went to meet him, having with him gifts, and all the goods of Damascus, the burdens of forty camels. And when he had stood before him, he said: “Your son, Benhadad, the king of Syria, sent me to you, saying: ‘Will I be able to be healed from this, my infirmity?’ ”
2 Kings 8:10	And Elisha said to him: “Go, tell him: ‘You will be healed.’ But the Lord has revealed to me that, dying he shall die.”
2 Kings 8:11	And he stood beside him, and he was so troubled that his face became flushed. And the man of God wept.
2 Kings 8:12	And Hazael said to him, “Why is my lord weeping?” And he said: “Because I know the evil that you will do to the sons of Israel. Their fortified cities you will burn with fire. And their young men you will kill with the sword. And you will destroy their little ones, and tear open the pregnant women.”
2 Kings 8:13	And Hazael said, “But what am I, your servant, a dog, that I would do this great thing?” And Elisha said, “The Lord has revealed to me that you will be the king of Syria.”
2 Kings 8:14	And when he had departed from Elisha, he went to his lord, who said to him, “What did Elisha say to you?” And he responded: “He said to me, ‘You shall receive health.’ ”
2 Kings 8:15	And when the next day had arrived, he took a small covering, and poured water on it, and he spread it over his face. And when he died, Hazael reigned in his place.
2 Kings 8:16	In the fifth year of Joram, the son of Ahab, the king of Israel, and of Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah: Jehoram, the son of Jehoshaphat, reigned as the king of Judah.
2 Kings 8:17	He was thirty-two years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for eight years in Jerusalem.
2 Kings 8:18	And he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had walked. For the daughter of Ahab was his wife. And he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord.
2 Kings 8:19	But the Lord was not willing to destroy Judah, because of David, his servant, just as he had promised him, so that he might grant a light to him and to his sons, for all days.
2 Kings 8:20	In his days, Idumea drew apart, so as not to be under Judah, and they appointed a king for themselves.
2 Kings 8:21	And so, Jehoram went to Zair, and all the chariots with him. And he rose up in the night, and he struck down the Idumeans who had surrounded him, and the leaders of the chariots. But the people fled to their tents.
2 Kings 8:22	And Idumea drew apart, so as not to be under Judah, even to this day. Then Libnah also drew apart, at the same time.
2 Kings 8:23	Now the rest of the words of Jehoram, and all that he did, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings 8:24	And Jehoram slept with his fathers, and he was buried with them in the city of David. And Ahaziah, his son, reigned in his place.
2 Kings 8:25	In the twelfth year of Joram, the son of Ahab, the king of Israel: Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram, the king of Judah, reigned.
2 Kings 8:26	Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for one year in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri, the king of Israel.
2 Kings 8:27	And he walked in the ways of the house of Ahab. And he did what is evil before the Lord, just as the house of Ahab did. For he was the son-in-law of the house of Ahab.
2 Kings 8:28	Also, he went with Joram, the son of Ahab, in order to fight against Hazael, the king of Syria, at Ramoth Gilead. And the Syrians had wounded Joram.
2 Kings 8:29	And he turned back, so that he might be cured at Jezreel. For the Syrians had wounded him at Ramoth, fighting against Hazael, the king of Syria. Then Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram, the king of Judah, descended to visit Joram, the son of Ahab, at Jezreel, because he was sick there.
2 Kings 9:1	Now the prophet Elisha called one of the sons of the prophets, and he said to him: “Gird your waist, and take this little bottle of oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth Gilead.
2 Kings 9:2	And when you arrive in that place, you will see Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi. And upon entering, you shall raise him up from the midst of his brothers, and you shall lead him into an inner room.
2 Kings 9:3	And taking the little bottle of oil, you shall pour it upon his head, and you shall say: ‘Thus says the Lord: I have anointed you as king over Israel.’ And you shall open the door and flee. And you shall not remain in that place.”
2 Kings 9:4	Therefore, the young man, a servant of the prophet, went away to Ramoth Gilead.
2 Kings 9:5	And he entered that place, and behold, the leaders of the army were sitting there, and he said, “I have a word for you, O prince.” And Jehu said, “For which one among us all?” And he said, “For you, O prince.”
2 Kings 9:6	And he rose up and entered into the room. And he poured the oil on his head, and he said: “Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: ‘I have anointed you as king over Israel, the people of the Lord.
2 Kings 9:7	And you will shall strike down the house of Ahab, your lord. And I will avenge the blood of my servants, the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the Lord, from the hand of Jezebel.
2 Kings 9:8	And I will destroy the entire house of Ahab. And I will cause to pass away from Ahab, whatever urinates against a wall, and whatever is lame, and whatever is least in Israel.
2 Kings 9:9	And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha, the son of Ahijah.
2 Kings 9:10	Also, the dogs will consume Jezebel, in the field of Jezreel. Neither will there be anyone who may bury her.’ ” And then he opened the door, and he fled.
2 Kings 9:11	Then Jehu went out to the servants of his lord. And they said to him: “Is everything well? Why has this insane man come to you?” And he said to them, “You know the man, and what he said.”
2 Kings 9:12	But they responded, “That is false; instead, you should tell us.” And he said to them, “He said to me these certain things, and he said, ‘Thus says the Lord: I have anointed you as king over Israel.’ ”
2 Kings 9:13	And so they hurried away. And each one, taking his cloak, placed it under his feet, in the manner of a seat for judgment. And they sounded the trumpet, and they said: “Jehu reigns!”
2 Kings 9:14	Then Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, conspired against Joram. Now Joram had besieged Ramoth Gilead, he and all of Israel, against Hazael, the king of Syria.
2 Kings 9:15	And he had returned, so that he might be cured at Jezreel, because of his wounds. For the Syrians had struck him, while he was fighting against Hazael, the king of Syria. And Jehu said, “If it pleases you, let no one depart, fleeing from the city; otherwise he may go and give a report in Jezreel.”
2 Kings 9:16	And he climbed up and set out for Jezreel, because Joram was sick there, and Ahaziah, the king of Judah, had gone down to visit Joram.
2 Kings 9:17	And so the watchman, who was standing upon the tower of Jezreel, saw the crowd of Jehu arriving, and he said, “I see a crowd.” And Joram said: “Take a chariot, and send to meet them. And those who go should say, ‘Is everything well?’ ”
2 Kings 9:18	Therefore, he who had climbed into the chariot went away to meet him, and he said, “The king says this: ‘Is everything peaceful?’ ” And Jehu said: “What peace is there for you? Pass by and follow me.” Also the watchman gave a report, saying, “The messenger went to them, but he did not return.”
2 Kings 9:19	And then he sent a second chariot of horses. And he went to them, and he said, “The king says this: ‘Is there peace?’ ” And Jehu said: “What peace is there for you? Pass by and follow me.”
2 Kings 9:20	Then the watchman gave a report, saying: “He went all the way to them, but he did not return. But their advance is like the advance of Jehu, the son of Nimshi. For he advances precipitously.”
2 Kings 9:21	And Joram said, “Yoke the chariot.” And they yoked his chariot. And Joram, the king of Israel, and Ahaziah, the king of Judah, departed, each in his chariot. And they went out to meet Jehu. And they met him in the field of Naboth, the Jezreelite.
2 Kings 9:22	And when Joram had seen Jehu, he said, “Is there peace, Jehu?” And he responded: “What is peace? For still the fornications of your mother, Jezebel, and her many poisons, are thriving.”
2 Kings 9:23	Then Joram turned his hand, and, fleeing, he said to Ahaziah, “Treachery, Ahaziah!”
2 Kings 9:24	But Jehu bent his bow with his hand, and he struck Joram between the shoulders. And the arrow went through his heart, and immediately he fell in his chariot.
2 Kings 9:25	And Jehu said to Bidkar, his commander: “Take and cast him into the field of Naboth, the Jezreelite. For I remember, when you and I, sitting in a chariot, were following Ahab, this man’s father, that the Lord lifted this burden upon him, saying:
2 Kings 9:26	‘Certainly, I will repay you in this field, says the Lord, for the blood of Naboth, and for the blood of his sons, which I saw yesterday, says the Lord.’ Therefore, take him now, and cast him into the field, in accord with the word of the Lord.”
2 Kings 9:27	But Ahaziah, the king of Judah, seeing this, fled along the way of the garden house. And Jehu pursued him, and he said, “Strike this one also in his chariot.” And they struck him on the ascent to Gur, which is beside Ibleam. But he fled into Megiddo, and he died there.
2 Kings 9:28	And his servants placed him upon his chariot, and they took him to Jerusalem. And they buried him in the sepulcher with his fathers, in the city of David.
2 Kings 9:29	In the eleventh year of Joram, the son of Ahab, Ahaziah reigned over Judah.
2 Kings 9:30	And Jehu went into Jezreel. But Jezebel, hearing of his arrival, painted her eyes with cosmetics, and adorned her head. And she watched through a window,
2 Kings 9:31	as Jehu was entering through the gate. And she said, “Is it possible for there to be peace for Zimri, who killed his lord?”
2 Kings 9:32	And Jehu lifted up his face to the window, and he said, “Who is this woman?” And two or three eunuchs bowed down before him.
2 Kings 9:33	And he said to them, “Throw her down with force.” And they threw her forcefully, and the wall was splattered with her blood, and the hoofs of the horses trampled her.
2 Kings 9:34	And when he had entered, so that he might eat and drink, he said: “Go, and see to that cursed woman, and bury her. For she is the daughter of a king.”
2 Kings 9:35	But when they had gone, so that they might bury her, they found nothing but the skull, and the feet, and the ends of her hands.
2 Kings 9:36	And returning, they reported to him. And Jehu said: “It is the word of the Lord, which he spoke though his servant, Elijah the Tishbite, saying: ‘In the field of Jezreel, the dogs will consume the flesh of Jezebel.
2 Kings 9:37	And the flesh of Jezebel will be like dung upon the face of the earth, in the field of Jezreel, so that those who pass by may say: Is this that same Jezebel?’ ”
2 Kings 10:1	Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And so Jehu wrote letters, and he sent to Samaria, to the nobles of the city, and to those greater by birth, and to those who had raised Ahab’s sons, saying:
2 Kings 10:2	“Immediately when you receive these letters, you who have your lord’s sons, and chariots, and horses, and reinforced cities, and weapons,
2 Kings 10:3	choose him who is better and who pleases you from among the sons of your lord, and set him on the throne of his father, and fight for the house of your lord.”
2 Kings 10:4	But they were vehemently afraid, and they said: “Behold, two kings were not able to stand before him. So how will we be able to withstand him?”
2 Kings 10:5	Therefore, those who were in charge of the house, and the prefects of the city, and those greater by birth, and those who raised the sons, sent to Jehu, saying: “We are your servants. Whatever you will order, we will do. But we will not appoint a king for ourselves. Do whatever pleases you.”
2 Kings 10:6	Then he again wrote letters to them a second time, saying: “If you are mine, and if you obey me, take the heads of the sons of your lord, and come to me at Jezreel at this same hour tomorrow.” Now the sons of the king, being seventy men, were being raised with the nobles of the city.
2 Kings 10:7	And when the letters had arrived to them, they took the sons of the king, and they killed the seventy men. And they placed their heads in baskets, and they sent these to him at Jezreel.
2 Kings 10:8	Then a messenger arrived and reported to him, saying, “They have brought the heads of the king’s sons.” And he responded, “Place them in two piles, beside the entrance of the gate, until morning.”
2 Kings 10:9	And when it had become light, he went out. And standing there, he said to all the people: “You are just. If I have conspired against my lord, and if I have killed him, who has struck down all of these?
2 Kings 10:10	Now therefore, see that none of the words of the Lord has fallen to the ground, which the Lord spoke over the house of Ahab, and that the Lord has done what he spoke by the hand of his servant Elijah.”
2 Kings 10:11	And so, Jehu struck down all who had remained from the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his nobles and friends and priests, until no remnant of them was left behind.
2 Kings 10:12	And he rose up and went to Samaria. And when he had arrived at the shepherds’ cabin along the way,
2 Kings 10:13	he found the brothers of Ahaziah, the king of Judah, and he said to them, “Who are you?” And they responded, “We are the brothers of Ahaziah, and we are going down to greet the sons of the king, and the sons of the queen.”
2 Kings 10:14	And he said, “Take them alive.” And when they had taken them alive, they cut their throats at the cistern beside the cabin, forty-two men. And he did not leave any of them behind.
2 Kings 10:15	And when he had gone away from there, he found Jehonadab, the son of Rechab, coming to meet him, and he blessed him. And he said to him, “Is your heart upright, just as my heart is with your heart?” And Jehonadab said, “It is.” Then he said, “If it is, then give me your hand.” He gave his hand to him. And so he lifted him up to himself in the chariot.
2 Kings 10:16	And he said to him, “Come with me, and see my zeal for the Lord.” And he gave him a place in his chariot.
2 Kings 10:17	And he led him into Samaria. And he struck down all who were left behind of Ahab in Samaria, even to the last one, in accord with the word of the Lord, which he spoke through Elijah.
2 Kings 10:18	Then Jehu gathered together the entire people. And he said to them: “Ahab worshipped Baal a little, but I will worship him even more.
2 Kings 10:19	Now therefore, summon to me all the prophets of Baal, and all his servants, and all his priests. Let no one be permitted not to come, for great is the sacrifice from me to Baal. Whoever will fail to come, he shall not live.” Now Jehu was doing this treacherously, so that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal.
2 Kings 10:20	And he said: “Sanctify a day of solemnity for Baal.” And he summoned
2 Kings 10:21	and sent into all the borders of Israel. And all the servants of Baal came. There was left behind not even one who did not arrive. And they entered into the temple of Baal. And the house of Baal was filled, all the way from end to end.
2 Kings 10:22	And he said to those who were over the vestments, “Bring forth vestments for all the servants of Baal.” And they brought forth vestments for them.
2 Kings 10:23	And Jehu, upon entering the temple of Baal with Jehonadab, the son of Rechab, said to the worshippers of Baal, “Inquire and see that there is no one with you from the servants of the Lord, but only from the servants of Baal.”
2 Kings 10:24	Then they entered, so that they might offer victims and holocausts. But Jehu had prepared for himself eighty men outside. And he had said to them, “If anyone escapes from among these men, whom I have led into your hands, your life will take the place of his life.”
2 Kings 10:25	Then it happened that, when the holocaust had been completed, Jehu ordered his soldiers and officers, saying: “Enter and strike them down. Let no one escape.” And the soldiers and officers struck them down with the edge of the sword, and they cast them out. And they went into the city of the temple of Baal,
2 Kings 10:26	and they took away the statue from the shine of Baal, and they burned it up
2 Kings 10:27	and crushed it. They also tore down the temple of Baal, and they made it into a latrine, even to this day.
2 Kings 10:28	And thus did Jehu wipe away Baal from Israel.
2 Kings 10:29	Yet truly, he did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin. Neither did he forsake the golden calves, which were in Bethel and Dan.
2 Kings 10:30	Then the Lord said to Jehu: “Since you have diligently carried out what was right and pleasing in my eyes, and since you have accomplished, against the house of Ahab, all that was in my heart, your sons shall sit upon the throne of Israel, even to the fourth generation.”
2 Kings 10:31	But Jehu did not take care, so that he might walk in the law of the Lord, the God of Israel, with all his heart. For he did not withdraw from the sins of Jeroboam, who had caused Israel to sin.
2 Kings 10:32	In those days, the Lord began to be weary of Israel. And Hazael struck them throughout all the parts of Israel,
2 Kings 10:33	from the Jordan opposite the eastern region, in all the land of Gilead, and Gad, and Reuben, and Manasseh, from Aroer, which is above the torrent Arnon, in both Gilead and Bashan.
2 Kings 10:34	But the rest of the words of Jehu, and all that he did, and his strength, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel?
2 Kings 10:35	And Jehu slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz, his son, reigned in his place.
2 Kings 10:36	Now the days during which Jehu reigned over Israel, in Samaria, were twenty-eight years.
2 Kings 11:1	Truly, Athaliah, the mother of Ahaziah, seeing that her son was dead, rose up and put to death all the royal offspring.
2 Kings 11:2	But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, the sister of Ahaziah, taking Jehoash, the son of Ahaziah, stole him away from the midst of the sons of the king who were being killed, out of the bedroom, with his nurse. And she hid him from the face of Athaliah, so that he would not be killed.
2 Kings 11:3	And he was with her for six years, hidden in the house of the Lord. But Athaliah reigned over the land.
2 Kings 11:4	Then, in the seventh year, Jehoiada sent for and took centurions and soldiers, and he brought them to himself in the temple of the Lord. And he formed a pact with them. And taking an oath with them in the house of the Lord, he revealed to them the son of the king.
2 Kings 11:5	And he commanded them, saying: “This is the word that you must do.
2 Kings 11:6	Let one third part of you enter on the Sabbath, and keep watch on the house of the king. And let one third part be at the gate of Sur. And let one third part be at the gate behind the dwelling place of the shield bearers. And you shall keep the watch on the house of Mesha.
2 Kings 11:7	Yet truly, let two parts of you, all who depart on the Sabbath, keep watch over the house of the Lord concerning the king.
2 Kings 11:8	And you shall surround him, having weapons in your hands. But if anyone will have entered the precinct of the temple, let him be killed. And you shall be with the king, entering and departing.”
2 Kings 11:9	And the centurions acted in accord with all the things that Jehoiada, the priest, had instructed them. And taking each one of their men who would enter on the Sabbath, with those who would depart on the Sabbath, they went to Jehoiada, the priest.
2 Kings 11:10	And he gave to them the spears and weapons of king David, which were in the house of the Lord.
2 Kings 11:11	And they stood, each one having his weapons in his hand, before the right side of the temple, all the way to the left side of the altar and of the shrine, surrounding the king.
2 Kings 11:12	And he led forth the son of the king. And he placed the diadem on him, and the testimony. And they made him king, and they anointed him. And clapping their hands, they said: “The king lives!”
2 Kings 11:13	Then Athaliah heard the sound of the people running. And entering to the crowd at the temple of the Lord,
2 Kings 11:14	she saw the king standing upon a tribunal, according to custom, and the singers and trumpets near him, and all the people of the land rejoicing and sounding the trumpets. And she tore her garments, and she cried out: “Conspiracy! Conspiracy!”
2 Kings 11:15	But Jehoiada gave orders to the centurions who were over the army, and he said to them: “Lead her away, beyond the precinct of the temple. And whoever will have followed her, let him be struck with the sword.” For the priest had said, “Do not allow her to be killed in the temple of the Lord.”
2 Kings 11:16	And they laid hands on her. And they pushed her through the way by which horses enter, beside the palace. And she was killed there.
2 Kings 11:17	Then Jehoiada formed a covenant between the Lord, and the king and the people, so that they would be the people of the Lord; and between the king and the people.
2 Kings 11:18	And all the people of the land entered the temple of Baal, and they tore down his altars, and they thoroughly crushed the statues. Also, they killed Mattan, the priest of Baal, before the altar. And the priest placed guards in the house of the Lord.
2 Kings 11:19	And he took the centurions, and the legions of the Cherethites and Pelethites, and all the people of the land, and together they led the king from the house of the Lord. And they went by way of the gate of the shield bearers into the palace. And he sat upon the throne of the kings.
2 Kings 11:20	And all the people of the land rejoiced. And the city was quieted. But Athaliah was slain with the sword at the house of the king.
2 Kings 11:21	Now Jehoash was seven years old when he had begun to reign.
2 Kings 12:1	In the seventh year of Jehu, Jehoash reigned. And he reigned for forty years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Zebiah from Beersheba.
2 Kings 12:2	And Jehoash did what was right in the sight of the Lord, during all the days that Jehoiada, the priest, taught him.
2 Kings 12:3	Yet still he did not take away the high places. For the people were still immolating, and burning incense, in the high places.
2 Kings 12:4	And Jehoash said to the priests: “All of the money for the holy things, which has been brought into the temple of the Lord from those who pass by, which is offered for the price of a soul, and which they bring into the temple of the Lord willingly, from their own free heart:
2 Kings 12:5	let the priests, according to their ranks, take and use it in order to repair the surfaces of the house, wherever they see anything in need of repair.”
2 Kings 12:6	And yet, even until the twenty-third year of king Jehoash, the priests did not repair the surfaces of the temple.
2 Kings 12:7	And king Jehoash called the high priest, Jehoiada, and the priests, saying to them: “Why have you not repaired the surfaces of the temple? Therefore, you may no longer accept money according to your ranks. Instead, return it in order that the temple may be repaired.”
2 Kings 12:8	And so the priests were prohibited from accepting any more money from the people to repair the surfaces of the house.
2 Kings 12:9	And the high priest, Jehoiada, took a certain chest, and he opened a hole in the top, and he placed it beside the altar, to the right of those who were entering the house of the Lord. And the priests who kept the doors put all the money in it which was being brought into the temple of the Lord.
2 Kings 12:10	And when they saw that there was a great amount of money in the chest, the scribe of the king and the high priest went up and poured it out. And they counted the money that was found in the house of the Lord.
2 Kings 12:11	And they gave it out, by number and measure, to the hands of those who were over the masons of the house of the Lord. And they weighed it out to the carpenters and masons, to those who were working in the house of the Lord
2 Kings 12:12	and restoring the surfaces, and to those who were cutting stones, and buying timber and stones to be cut, so that the repairs to the house of the Lord might be finished: for all that was needed toward the expenses in order to strengthen the house.
2 Kings 12:13	Yet truly, from the same money, they did not make for the temple of the Lord water pitchers, or small hooks, or censers, or trumpets, or any vessel of gold or silver, from the money that was brought into the temple of the Lord.
2 Kings 12:14	For it was given to those who were doing the work, so that the temple of the Lord might be repaired.
2 Kings 12:15	And they did not ration the money to the men who received it in order to distribute it to the artisans. Instead, they bestowed it with faith.
2 Kings 12:16	Yet truly, the money for offenses and the money for sins, they did not bring into the temple of the Lord, since it was for the priests.
2 Kings 12:17	Then Hazael, the king of Syria, ascended and fought against Gath, and he captured it. And he directed his face, so that he might ascend against Jerusalem.
2 Kings 12:18	For this reason, Jehoash, the king of Judah, took all the sanctified things, which Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, the kings of Judah, had consecrated and which he himself had offered, and all the silver that could be found in the treasuries of the temple of the Lord and in the palace of the king, and he sent it to Hazael, the king of Syria. And so he withdrew from Jerusalem.
2 Kings 12:19	Now the rest of the words of Jehoash, and all that he did, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings 12:20	Then his servants rose up and conspired among themselves. And they struck down Jehoash, at the house of Millo, on the descent of Silla.
2 Kings 12:21	For Jozacar, the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad, the son of Shomer, his servants, struck him, and he died. And they buried him with his fathers in the city of David. And Amaziah, his son, reigned in his place.
2 Kings 13:1	In the twenty-third year of Joash, the son of Ahaziah, the king of Judah, Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, reigned over Israel, in Samaria, for seventeen years.
2 Kings 13:2	And he did evil before the Lord. And he followed the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin. And he did not turn aside from these.
2 Kings 13:3	And the fury of the Lord was enraged against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael, the king of Syria, and into the hand of Benhadad, the son of Hazael, during all the days.
2 Kings 13:4	But Jehoahaz petitioned the face of the Lord, and the Lord heeded him. For he saw the anguish of Israel, because the king of Syria had oppressed them.
2 Kings 13:5	And the Lord gave a savior to Israel. And they were freed from the hand of the king of Syria. And the sons of Israel lived in their tabernacles, just as yesterday and the day before.
2 Kings 13:6	Yet truly, they did not withdraw from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who had caused Israel to sin. Instead, they walked by them. And there was even a sacred grove still remaining in Samaria.
2 Kings 13:7	And there was left to Jehoahaz from the people nothing but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand foot soldiers. For the king of Syria had killed them, and he had reduced them to become like dust on a threshing floor.
2 Kings 13:8	But the rest of the words of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his strength, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel?
2 Kings 13:9	And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria. And Joash, his son, reigned in his place.
2 Kings 13:10	In the thirty-seventh year of Jehoash, the king of Judah, Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, reigned over Israel, in Samaria, for sixteen years.
2 Kings 13:11	And he did what is evil in the sight of the Lord. He did not turn aside from all the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin. Instead, he walked by them.
2 Kings 13:12	But the rest of the words of Joash, and all that he did, and his strength, the manner in which he fought against Amaziah, the king of Judah, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel?
2 Kings 13:13	And Joash slept with his fathers. Then Jeroboam sat upon his throne. And Joash was buried in Samaria, with the kings of Israel.
2 Kings 13:14	Now Elisha was sick of the infirmity from which he also died. And Joash, the king of Israel, descended to him. And he was weeping before him, and saying: “My father, my father! The chariot of Israel and its driver!”
2 Kings 13:15	And Elisha said to him, “Bring a bow and arrows.” And when he had brought a bow and arrows to him,
2 Kings 13:16	he said to the king of Israel, “Place your hand upon the bow.” And when he had placed his hand, Elisha place his own hands over the hands of the king.
2 Kings 13:17	And he said, “Open the window toward the east.” And when he had opened it, Elisha said, “Shoot an arrow.” And he shot it. And Elisha said: “It is the arrow of the salvation of the Lord, and the arrow of salvation against Syria. And you shall strike the Syrians at Aphek, until you consume them.”
2 Kings 13:18	And he said, “Take the arrows.” And when he had taken them, he then said to him, “Strike an arrow against the ground.” And when he had struck three times, and he had stood still,
2 Kings 13:19	the man of God became angry against him. And he said: “If you had struck five or six or seven times, you would have struck down Syria, even until it was consumed. But now you will strike it three times.”
2 Kings 13:20	Then Elisha died, and they buried him. And the robbers from Moab came into the land in the same year.
2 Kings 13:21	But certain ones who were burying a man saw the robbers, and they cast the dead body into the sepulcher of Elisha. But when it had touched the bones of Elisha, the man revived, and he stood upon his feet.
2 Kings 13:22	Now Hazael, the king of Syria, afflicted Israel during all the days of Jehoahaz.
2 Kings 13:23	But the Lord took pity on them, and he returned to them, because of his covenant, which he had made with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob. And he was not willing to destroy them, nor to cast them out completely, even to the present time.
2 Kings 13:24	Then Hazael, the king of Syria, died. And Benhadad, his son, reigned in his place.
2 Kings 13:25	Now Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz, by a just war, took the cities from the hand of Benhadad, the son of Hazael, which he had taken from the hand of Jehoahaz, his father. Jehoash struck him three times, and he restored the cities to Israel.
2 Kings 14:1	In the second year of Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz, the king of Israel: Amaziah, the son of Jehoash, reigned as king of Judah.
2 Kings 14:2	He was twenty-five years old when he had begun to reign. And he reigned for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Jehoaddin from Jerusalem.
2 Kings 14:3	And he did what is right before the Lord, yet truly, not like David, his father. He acted in accord with all the things that his father Jehoash did,
2 Kings 14:4	except for this alone: he did not take away the high places. For still the people were immolating, and burning incense, in the high places.
2 Kings 14:5	And when he had obtained the kingdom, he struck down those of his servants who had killed his father, the king.
2 Kings 14:6	But the sons of those who had been killed he did not put to death, in accord with what was written in the book of the law of Moses, just as the Lord instructed, saying: “The fathers shall not die for the sons, and the sons shall not die for the fathers. Instead, each one shall die for his own sin.”
2 Kings 14:7	He struck down ten thousand men of Idumea, in the Valley of the Salt Pits. And he captured ‘the Rock’ in battle, and he called its name ‘Subdued by God,’ even to the present day.
2 Kings 14:8	Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, the king of Israel, saying: “Come, and let us see one another.”
2 Kings 14:9	And Jehoash, the king of Israel, sent a reply to Amaziah, the king of Judah, saying: “A thistle of Lebanon sent to a cedar, which is in Lebanon, saying: ‘Give your daughter as wife to my son.’ And the beasts of the forest, which are in Lebanon, passed by and trampled the thistle.
2 Kings 14:10	You have struck and prevailed over Idumea. And your heart has lifted you up. Be content with your own glory, and be seated your own house. Why would you provoke evil, so that you would fall, and Judah with you?”
2 Kings 14:11	But Amaziah was not quieted. And so Jehoash, the king of Israel, went up. And he and Amaziah, the king of Judah, saw one another at Beth-shemesh, a town in Judah.
2 Kings 14:12	And Judah was struck down before Israel, and they fled, each to their own tents.
2 Kings 14:13	And truly, Jehoash, the king of Israel, captured Amaziah, the king of Judah, the son of Jehoash, the son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh. And he brought him to Jerusalem. And he breached the wall of Jerusalem, from the gate of Ephraim as far as the gate of the Corner, four hundred cubits.
2 Kings 14:14	And he took away all the gold and silver, and all the vessels, which were found in the house of the Lord and in the treasuries of the king, and he returned to Samaria with hostages.
2 Kings 14:15	But the rest of the words of Jehoash, which he accomplished, and his strength, with which he fought against Amaziah, the king of Judah, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel?
2 Kings 14:16	And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and he was buried in Samaria, with the kings of Israel. And Jeroboam, his son, reigned in his place.
2 Kings 14:17	Now Amaziah, the son of Jehoash, the king of Judah, lived for fifteen years after the death of Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz, the king of Israel.
2 Kings 14:18	And the rest of the words of Amaziah, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings 14:19	And they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem. And he fled to Lachish. And they sent after him, to Lachish, and they killed him there.
2 Kings 14:20	And they carried him away on horses. And he was buried in Jerusalem with his fathers, in the city of David.
2 Kings 14:21	Then all the people of Judah took Azariah, at sixteen years from birth, and they appointed him as king in place of his father, Amaziah.
2 Kings 14:22	He built up Elath, and he restored it to Judah, after which the king slept with his fathers.
2 Kings 14:23	In the fifteenth year of Amaziah, the son of Jehoash, the king of Judah: Jeroboam, the son of Jehoash, the king of Israel, reigned, in Samaria, for forty-one years.
2 Kings 14:24	And he did what is evil before the Lord. He did not withdraw from all the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin.
2 Kings 14:25	He restored the borders of Israel, from the entrance of Hamath as far as the Sea of the Wilderness, in accord with the word of the Lord, the God of Israel, which he spoke through his servant, the prophet Jonah, the son of Amittai, who was from Gath, which is in Hepher.
2 Kings 14:26	For the Lord saw the exceedingly bitter affliction of Israel, and that they were being consumed, even to those who were enclosed in prison, and even to the least ones, and that there was no one who would help Israel.
2 Kings 14:27	But the Lord did not say that he would wipe away the name of Israel from under heaven. So instead, he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam, the son of Jehoash.
2 Kings 14:28	But the rest of the words of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his strength, with which he went to battle, and the manner in which he restored Damascus and Hamath to Judah, in Israel, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel?
2 Kings 14:29	And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, the kings of Israel. And Zechariah, his son, reigned in his place.
2 Kings 15:1	In the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam, the king of Israel: Azariah, the son of Amaziah, reigned as king of Judah.
2 Kings 15:2	He was sixteen years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for fifty-two years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.
2 Kings 15:3	And he did what was pleasing before the Lord, in accord with all that his father, Amaziah, did.
2 Kings 15:4	Yet truly, he did not demolish the high places. And still the people were sacrificing, and burning incense, in the high places.
2 Kings 15:5	Now the Lord struck the king, and he became a leper, even until the day of his death. And he was living in a separate house by himself. And truly, Jotham, the son of the king, governed the palace, and he judged the people of the land.
2 Kings 15:6	Now the rest of the words of Azariah, and all that he did, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings 15:7	And Azariah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his ancestors in the city of David. And Jotham, his son, reigned in his place.
2 Kings 15:8	In the thirty-eighth year of Azariah, the king of Judah: Zechariah, the son of Jeroboam, reigned over Israel, in Samaria, for six months.

2 Kings 15:10	Then Shallum, the son of Jabesh, conspired against him. And he struck him openly, and killed him. And he reigned in his place.
2 Kings 15:11	Now the rest of the words of Zechariah, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel?
2 Kings 15:12	This was the word of the Lord, which he spoke to Jehu, saying: “Your sons, even to the fourth generation, shall sit upon the throne of Israel.” And so it happened.
2 Kings 15:13	Shallum, the son of Jabesh, reigned in the thirty-ninth year of Azariah, the king of Judah. And he reigned for one month, in Samaria.
2 Kings 15:14	And Menahem, the son of Gadi, ascended from Tirzah. And he went into Samaria, and he struck Shallum, the son of Jabesh, in Samaria. And he killed him, and reigned in his place.

2 Kings 15:16	Then Menahem struck Tirzah, and all who were in it, and its borders around Tirzah. For they were not willing to open to him. And he killed all of its pregnant women, and he tore them open.
2 Kings 15:17	In the thirty-ninth year of Azariah, the king of Judah: Menahem, son of Gadi, reigned over Israel for ten years, in Samaria.
2 Kings 15:18	And he did what was evil before the Lord. He did not withdraw from the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin, during all his days.
2 Kings 15:19	Then Pul, the king of the Assyrians, came into the land. And Menahem gave Pul one thousand talents of silver, so that he would be a help to him, and so that he might strengthen his kingdom.
2 Kings 15:20	And Menahem proclaimed a tax upon Israel, on all who were powerful and wealthy, so that each one would give to the king of the Assyrians fifty shekels of silver. Then the king of the Assyrians turned back, and he did not remain in the land.

2 Kings 15:25	Then Pekah, the son of Remaliah, his commander, conspired against him. And he struck him in Samaria, in the tower of the king’s house, near Argob and Arieh, and with him fifty men from the sons of the Gileadites. And he killed him, and reigned in his place.
2 Kings 15:26	Now the rest of the words of Pekahiah, and all that he did, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel?

2 Kings 15:30	Then Hoshea, the son of Elah, conspired and carried out treachery against Pekah, the son of Remaliah. And he struck him, and killed him. And he reigned in his place, in the twentieth year of Jotham, the son of Uzziah.

2 Kings 15:33	He was twenty-five years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok.
2 Kings 15:34	And he did what was pleasing before the Lord. In accord with all that his father, Uzziah, had done, so he did.
2 Kings 15:35	Yet truly, he did not take away the high places. And still the people were immolating, and burning incense, in the high places. But he edified the gate of the house of the Lord to be very sublime.
2 Kings 15:36	Now the rest of the words of Jotham, and all that he did, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings 15:37	In those days, the Lord began to send, into Judah, Rezin, the king of Syria, and Pekah, the son of Remaliah.
2 Kings 15:38	And Jotham slept with his fathers, and he was buried with them in the city of David, his father. And Ahaz, his son, reigned in his place.
2 Kings 16:1	In the seventeenth year of Pekah, the son of Remaliah: Ahaz, the son of Jotham, reigned as king of Judah.
2 Kings 16:2	Ahaz was twenty years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. He did not do what was pleasing in the sight of the Lord, his God, as his father David did.
2 Kings 16:3	Instead, he walked in the way of the kings of Israel. Moreover, he even consecrated his son, making him pass through fire, in accord with the idols of the nations that the Lord destroyed before the sons of Israel.
2 Kings 16:4	Also, he was immolating victims, and burning incense, in the high places, and on the hills, and under every leafy tree.
2 Kings 16:5	Then Rezin, the king of Syria, and Pekah, the son of Remaliah, the king of Israel, ascended to do battle against Jerusalem. And they besieged Ahaz, but they were not able to overcome him.
2 Kings 16:6	At that time, Rezin, the king of Syria, restored Elath to Syria, and he expelled the Judeans from Elath. And the Idumeans went into Elath, and they have lived there, even to this day.
2 Kings 16:7	Then Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser, the king of the Assyrians, saying: “I am your servant, and I am your son. Ascend and accomplish my salvation from the hand of the king of Syria, and from the hand of the king of Israel, who have risen up together against me.”
2 Kings 16:8	And when he had collected the silver and the gold that could be found in the house of the Lord, and in the treasuries of the king, he sent it as a gift to the king of the Assyrians.
2 Kings 16:9	And he agreed to his will. For the king of the Assyrians ascended against Damascus, and he laid waste to it. And he carried away its inhabitants to Cyrene. But Rezin he killed.
2 Kings 16:10	And king Ahaz traveled to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser, the king of the Assyrians. And when he had seen the altar of Damascus, king Ahaz sent to Uriah, the priest, its pattern and likeness, according to all of its work.
2 Kings 16:11	And Uriah, the priest, constructed an altar in accord with all that king Ahaz had commanded from Damascus. Uriah, the priest, did so, until king Ahaz arrived from Damascus.
2 Kings 16:12	And when the king had arrived from Damascus, he saw the altar, and he venerated it. And he went up and immolated holocausts, with his own sacrifice.
2 Kings 16:13	And he offered libations, and he poured out the blood of the peace offerings, which he had offered, upon the altar.
2 Kings 16:14	But the altar of brass, which was before the Lord, he took away from the face of the temple, and from the place of the altar, and from the place of the temple of the Lord. And he positioned it at the side of the altar, toward the north.
2 Kings 16:15	Also, king Ahaz instructed Uriah, the priest, saying: “Upon the great altar, offer the morning holocaust, and the evening sacrifice, and the holocaust of the king, and his sacrifice, and the holocaust of the entire people of the land, and their sacrifices. But their libations, and all the blood of the holocaust, and all the blood of the victim, you shall pour out upon it. Then truly, the altar of brass shall be prepared for use at my will.”
2 Kings 16:16	And so Uriah, the priest, acted in accord with all that king Ahaz had instructed to him.
2 Kings 16:17	Then king Ahaz took away the engraved bases, and the basin that was upon them. And he took down the sea from the bronze oxen, which were holding it up. And he positioned it upon a layer of pavement stone.
2 Kings 16:18	Also, the canopy for the Sabbath, which he had built in the temple, and the exterior entrance of the king, he converted into the temple of the Lord, because of the king of the Assyrians.
2 Kings 16:19	Now the rest of the words of Ahaz that he did, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings 16:20	And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and he was buried with them in the city of David. And Hezekiah, his son, reigned in his place.
2 Kings 17:1	In the twelfth year of Ahaz, the king of Judah: Hoshea, the son of Elah, reigned over Israel, in Samaria, for nine years.
2 Kings 17:2	And he did evil before the Lord, but not like the kings of Israel who had been before him.
2 Kings 17:3	Shalmaneser, the king of the Assyrians, ascended against him. And Hoshea became a servant to him, and he paid him tribute.
2 Kings 17:4	And when the king of the Assyrians discovered that Hoshea, striving to rebel, had sent messengers to Sais, to the king of Egypt, so as not to present the tribute to the king of the Assyrians, as he had been accustomed to do each year, he besieged him. And having been bound, he cast him into prison.
2 Kings 17:5	And he wandered through the entire land. And ascending to Samaria, he besieged it for three years.
2 Kings 17:6	And in the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of the Assyrians captured Samaria, and he carried away Israel to Assyria. And he stationed them in Halah and in Habor, beside the river of Gozan, in the cities of the Medes.
2 Kings 17:7	For it happened that, when the sons of Israel had sinned against the Lord, their God, who had led them away from the land of Egypt, from the hand of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, they worshipped strange gods.
2 Kings 17:8	And they walked according to the rituals of the nations that the Lord had consumed in the sight of the sons of Israel, and of the kings of Israel. For they had acted similarly.
2 Kings 17:9	And the sons of Israel offended the Lord, their God, with deeds that were not upright. And they built for themselves high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city.
2 Kings 17:10	And they made for themselves statues and sacred groves, on every high hill and under every leafy tree.
2 Kings 17:11	And they were burning incense there, upon altars, in the manner of the nations that the Lord had removed from their face. And they did wicked deeds, provoking the Lord.
2 Kings 17:12	And they worshipped impurities, concerning which the Lord instructed them that they should not do this word.
2 Kings 17:13	And the Lord testified to them, in Israel and in Judah, through the hand of all the prophets and seers, saying: “Return from your wicked ways, and keep my precepts and ceremonies, in accord with the entire law, which I instructed to your fathers, and just as I sent to you by the hand of my servants, the prophets.”
2 Kings 17:14	But they did not listen. Instead, they hardened their necks to be like the neck of their fathers, who were not willing to obey the Lord, their God.
2 Kings 17:15	And they cast aside his ordinances, and the covenant that he formed with their fathers, and the testimonies which he testified to them. And they pursued vanities and acted vainly. And they followed the nations that were all around them, concerning the things which the Lord had commanded them not to do, and which they did.
2 Kings 17:16	And they abandoned all the precepts of the Lord, their God. And they made for themselves two molten calves and sacred groves. And they adored the entire celestial army. And they served Baal.
2 Kings 17:17	And they consecrated their sons and their daughters through fire. And they devoted themselves to divinations and soothsaying. And they delivered themselves into the doing of evil before the Lord, so that they provoked him.
2 Kings 17:18	And the Lord became vehemently angry with Israel, and he took them away from his sight. And there remained no one, except the tribe of Judah alone.
2 Kings 17:19	But even Judah did not keep the commandments of the Lord, their God. Instead, they walked in the errors of Israel, which they had wrought.
2 Kings 17:20	And the Lord cast aside all of the offspring of Israel. And he afflicted them, and he delivered them into the hand of despoilers, until he drove them away from his face,
2 Kings 17:21	even from that time when Israel was torn away from the house of David, and they appointed for themselves Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, as king. For Jeroboam separated Israel from the Lord, and he caused them to sin a great sin.
2 Kings 17:22	And the sons of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam, which he had done. And they did not withdraw from these,
2 Kings 17:23	even when the Lord carried away Israel from his face, just as he had said by the hand of all his servants, the prophets. And Israel was carried away from their land into Assyria, even to this day.
2 Kings 17:24	Then the king of the Assyrians brought some from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Avva, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim. And he located them in the cities of Samaria, in place of the sons of Israel. And they possessed Samaria, and they lived in its cities.
2 Kings 17:25	And when they had begun to live there, they did not fear the Lord. And the Lord sent lions among them, which were killing them.
2 Kings 17:26	And this was reported to the king of the Assyrians, and it was said: “The peoples that you transferred and caused to live in the cities of Samaria, they are ignorant of the ordinances of the God of the land. And so the Lord has sent lions among them. And behold, they have killed them, because they were ignorant of the rituals of the God of the land.”
2 Kings 17:27	Then the king of the Assyrians commanded, saying: “Lead to that place one of the priests, whom you brought as a captive from there. And let him go and live with them. And let him teach them the ordinances of the God of the land.”
2 Kings 17:28	And so, when one of the priests, who had been led away captive from Samaria, had arrived, he lived in Bethel. And he taught them how they should worship the Lord.
2 Kings 17:29	And each of the nations made gods of their own, and they placed them in the shrines of the high places, which the Samaritans had made: nation after nation, in their cities in which they were living.
2 Kings 17:30	So the men of Babylon made Soccoth-benoth; and the men of Cuth made Nergal; and the men of Hamath made Ashima;
2 Kings 17:31	and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak. Then those who were from Sepharvaim burned up their children with fire, for the gods of Sepharvaim: Adram-melech and Anam-melech.
2 Kings 17:32	But nevertheless, they worshipped the Lord. Then they made for themselves, from the least of the people, priests of the high places. And they placed them in the shrines of the high places.
2 Kings 17:33	And though they worshipped the Lord, they also served their own gods, according to the custom of the nations from which they had been transferred into Samaria.
2 Kings 17:34	Even to the present day, they follow the ancient customs; they do not fear the Lord, and they do not keep his ceremonies, and judgments, and law, and commandment, which the Lord had instructed to the sons of Jacob, whom he named Israel.
2 Kings 17:35	And he had struck a covenant with them, and he had commanded them, saying: “You shall not fear foreign gods, and you shall not adore them, and you shall not worship them, and you shall not sacrifice to them.
2 Kings 17:36	But the Lord, your God, who led you away from the land of Egypt, with great strength and with an outstretched arm, him shall you fear, and him shall you adore, and to him shall you sacrifice.
2 Kings 17:37	Also, the ceremonies, and judgments, and law, and commandment, which he wrote for you, you shall keep so that you do them for all days. And you shall not fear strange gods.
2 Kings 17:38	And the covenant, which he struck with you, you shall not forget; neither shall you worship strange gods.
2 Kings 17:39	But you shall fear the Lord, your God. And he will rescue you from the hand of all your enemies.”
2 Kings 17:40	Yet truly, they did not listen to this. Instead, they acted in accord with their earlier custom.
2 Kings 17:41	And such were these nations: to some extent fearing the Lord, yet nevertheless also serving their idols. As for their sons and grandsons, just as their fathers acted, so also did they act, even to the present day.
2 Kings 18:1	In the third year of Hoshea, the son of Elah, the king of Israel: Hezekiah, the son of Ahaz, reigned as king of Judah.
2 Kings 18:2	He was twenty-five years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Abi, the daughter of Zechariah.
2 Kings 18:3	And he did what was good before the Lord, in accord with all that his father David had done.
2 Kings 18:4	He destroyed the high places, and he crushed the statues, and he cut down the sacred groves. And he broke apart the bronze serpent, which Moses had made. For even until that time, the sons of Israel were burning incense to it. And he called its name Nehushtan.
2 Kings 18:5	He hoped in the Lord, the God of Israel. And after him, there was no one similar to him, among all the kings of Judah, nor even among any of those who were before him.
2 Kings 18:6	And he clung to the Lord, and he did not withdraw from his footsteps, and he carried out his commandments, which the Lord had instructed to Moses.
2 Kings 18:7	Therefore, the Lord was also with him. And he conducted himself wisely in all the things to which he went forth. Also, he rebelled against the king of the Assyrians, and he did not serve him.
2 Kings 18:8	He struck the Philistines as far as Gaza, and in all their borders, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city.
2 Kings 18:9	In the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea, the son of Elah, the king of Israel: Shalmaneser, the king of the Assyrians, ascended to Samaria, and he fought against it,
2 Kings 18:10	and he seized it. For after three years, in the sixth year of Hezekiah, that is, in the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Israel, Samaria was captured.
2 Kings 18:11	And the king of the Assyrians took away Israel into Assyria. And he located them in Halah and in Habor, at the rivers of Gozan, in the cities of the Medes.
2 Kings 18:12	For they did not listen to the voice of the Lord, their God. Instead, they transgressed his covenant. All that Moses, the servant of the Lord, had instructed, they would neither hear, nor do.
2 Kings 18:13	In the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, Sennacherib, the king of the Assyrians, went up to all the fortified cities of Judah, and he captured them.
2 Kings 18:14	Then Hezekiah, the king of Judah, sent messengers to the king of the Assyrians at Lachish, saying: “I have offended. Withdraw from me, and all that you will impose upon me, I will bear.” And so the king of the Assyrians levied a tax upon Hezekiah, the king of Judah, of three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.
2 Kings 18:15	And Hezekiah gave all the silver that had been found in the house of the Lord, and in the treasuries of the king.
2 Kings 18:16	At that time, Hezekiah broke apart the doors of the temple of the Lord, with the plates of gold which he had affixed to them. And he gave these to the king of the Assyrians.
2 Kings 18:17	Then the king of the Assyrians sent Tartan, and Rabsaris, and Rabshakeh, from Lachish, to king Hezekiah, with a powerful hand, to Jerusalem. And when they had ascended, they arrived in Jerusalem, and they stood beside the aqueduct of the upper pool, which is along the way of the fuller’s field.
2 Kings 18:18	And they called for the king. But there went out to them Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, the first ruler of the house, and Shebnah, the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the keeper of records.
2 Kings 18:19	And Rabshakeh said to them: “Speak to Hezekiah: Thus says the great king, the king of the Assyrians: What is this faith, in which you strive?
2 Kings 18:20	Perhaps, you have taken counsel, so that you would prepare yourself for battle. In whom do you trust, so that you would dare to rebel?
2 Kings 18:21	Do you hope in Egypt, that staff of a broken reed, which, if a man would lean upon it, breaking, it would pierce his hand? Such is Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, to all who would trust in him.
2 Kings 18:22	But if you say to me: ‘We have faith in the Lord, our God.’ Is it not he, whose high places and altars Hezekiah has taken away? And did he not instruct Judah and Jerusalem: ‘You shall adore before this altar in Jerusalem?’
2 Kings 18:23	Now therefore, cross over to my lord, the king of the Assyrians, and I will give to you two thousand horses, and we will see if you even have enough riders for them.
2 Kings 18:24	So how can you resist one prince from the least of my lord’s servants? Do you have faith in Egypt because of the chariots and horsemen?
2 Kings 18:25	Is it not by the will of the Lord that I have chosen to ascend to this place, so that I may destroy it? The Lord said to me: ‘Ascend to this land, and destroy it.’ ”
2 Kings 18:26	Then Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, and Shebnah, and Joah, said to Rabshakeh: “We beseech you, that you may speak to us, your servants, in Syriac. For we understand that language to some extent. And do not speak to us in the Jews’ language, in the hearing of the people, who are upon the wall.”
2 Kings 18:27	And Rabshakeh responded to them, saying: “Has my lord sent me to your lord and to you, so that I may speak these words, and not instead to the men who are sitting upon the wall, so that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own urine with you?”
2 Kings 18:28	And so, Rabshakeh stood up, and he exclaimed in a great voice, in the Jews’ language, and he said: “Listen to the words of the great king, the king of the Assyrians.
2 Kings 18:29	Thus says the king: Let not Hezekiah lead you astray. For he will not be able to rescue you from my hand.
2 Kings 18:30	And do not let him give you faith in the Lord, saying: ‘The Lord will rescue and free us, and this city will not be delivered into the hand of the king of the Assyrians.’
2 Kings 18:31	Do not choose to listen to Hezekiah. For thus says the king of the Assyrians: Do with me what is for your own good, and come out to me. And each one of you will eat from his own vine, and from his own fig tree. And you shall drink water from your own wells,
2 Kings 18:32	until I arrive and transfer you into a land, similar to your own land, a fruitful and fertile land of wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olives and oil and honey. And you will live, and not die. Do not choose to listen to Hezekiah, who deceives you, saying: ‘The Lord will free us.’
2 Kings 18:33	Have any of the gods of the nations freed their land from the hand of the king of Assyria?
2 Kings 18:34	Where is the god of Hamath, and of Arpad? Where is the god of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and of Avva? Have they freed Samaria from my hand?
2 Kings 18:35	Which ones among all the gods of the lands have rescued their region from my hand, so that the Lord would be able to rescue Jerusalem from my hand?”
2 Kings 18:36	But the people were silent, and they did not respond at all to him. For indeed, they had received an instruction from the king that they should not respond to him.
2 Kings 18:37	And Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, the first ruler of the house, and Shebnah, the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the keeper of records, went to Hezekiah with their garments torn. And they reported to him the words of Rabshakeh.
2 Kings 19:1	And when king Hezekiah had heard this, he tore his garments, and he covered himself with sackcloth, and he entered the house of the Lord.
2 Kings 19:2	And he sent Eliakim, the first ruler of the house, and Shebnah, the scribe, and the elders from the priests, covered with sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz.
2 Kings 19:3	And they said to him: “Thus says Hezekiah: This day is a day of tribulation, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy. The sons are ready to be born, but the woman in labor does not have the strength.
2 Kings 19:4	Perhaps the Lord, your God, may hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of the Assyrians, his lord, sent so that he would reproach the living God, and rebuke with words, which the Lord, your God, has heard. And so, offer a prayer on behalf of the remnant that has been found.”
2 Kings 19:5	And the servants of king Hezekiah went to Isaiah.
2 Kings 19:6	And Isaiah said to them: “So shall you say to your lord. Thus says the Lord: Do not be afraid before the face of the words that you have heard, by which the servants of the king of the Assyrians have blasphemed me.
2 Kings 19:7	Behold, I will send a spirit to him, and he will hear a report, and he will return to his own land. And I will bring him down by the sword in his own land.”
2 Kings 19:8	Then Rabshakeh returned, and he found the king of the Assyrians fighting against Libnah. For he had heard that he had withdrawn from Lachish.
2 Kings 19:9	And when he had heard from Tirhakah, the king of Ethiopia, saying, “Behold, he has gone out so that he may fight against you,” and when he went forth against him, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying:
2 Kings 19:10	“So shall you say to Hezekiah, the king of Judah: Let not your God, in whom you trust, lead you astray. And you should not say, ‘Jerusalem will not be delivered into the hands of the king of the Assyrians.’
2 Kings 19:11	For you yourself have heard what the kings of the Assyrians have done to all the lands, the manner in which they have laid waste to them. Therefore, how would you alone be able to be freed?
2 Kings 19:12	Have the gods of the nations freed any of those whom my fathers have destroyed, such as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the sons of Eden, who were at Telassar?
2 Kings 19:13	Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, and of Hena, and of Avva?”
2 Kings 19:14	And so, when Hezekiah had received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and had read it, he ascended to the house of the Lord, and he spread it out before the Lord.
2 Kings 19:15	And he prayed in his sight, saying: “O Lord, God of Israel, who sits upon the cherubim, you alone are God, over all the kings of the earth. You made heaven and earth.
2 Kings 19:16	Incline your ear, and listen. Open your eyes, O Lord, and see. And hear all the words of Sennacherib, who sent so that he might reproach the living God before us.
2 Kings 19:17	Truly, O Lord, the kings of the Assyrians have devastated all peoples and lands.
2 Kings 19:18	And they have cast their gods into the fire. For they were not gods, but instead were the works of men’s hands, out of wood and stone. And so they destroyed them.
2 Kings 19:19	Now therefore, O Lord our God, bring us salvation from his hand, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you alone are the Lord God.”
2 Kings 19:20	Then Isaiah, the son of Amoz, sent to Hezekiah, saying: “Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: I have heard what you beseeched from me, concerning Sennacherib, the king of the Assyrians.
2 Kings 19:21	This is the word that the Lord has spoken about him: The virgin daughter of Zion has spurned and ridiculed you. The daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head behind your back.
2 Kings 19:22	Whom have you reproached, and whom have you blasphemed? Against whom have you exalted your voice, and lifted up your eyes on high? Against the Holy One of Israel!
2 Kings 19:23	By the hand of your servants, you have reproach the Lord, and you have said: ‘By the multitude of my chariots I have ascended to the heights of the mountains, to the summit of Lebanon. And I have cut down its sublime cedars, and its elect spruce trees. And I have entered even to its limits. And its forest of Carmel,
2 Kings 19:24	I have cut down. And I drank foreign waters, and I dried up all the enclosed waters with the steps of my feet.’
2 Kings 19:25	But have you not heard what I have done from the beginning? From the days of antiquity, I have formed it, and now I have brought it to be. And fortified cities of fighting men will become piles of ruins.
2 Kings 19:26	And whoever may settle in these, they have trembled, with a weak hand, and they have been confounded. They have become like the hay of the field, and like weeds sprouting on the rooftops, which dry up before they reached maturity.
2 Kings 19:27	Your habitation, and your exit, and your entrance, and your way, I knew beforehand, along with your fury against me.
2 Kings 19:28	You have been maddened against me, and your arrogance has ascended to my ears. And so, I will place a ring in your nose, and a bit between your lips. And I will lead you back along the way by which you came.
2 Kings 19:29	But as for you, Hezekiah, this shall be a sign: Eat this year whatever you will find, and in the second year, whatever may spring up of itself. But in the third year, sow and reap; plant vineyards, and eat from their fruit.
2 Kings 19:30	And whatever will have been left behind, from the house of Judah, shall send a root downward, and shall bear fruit upward.
2 Kings 19:31	Indeed, a remnant shall go forth from Jerusalem, and what may be saved shall go forth from mount Zion. The zeal of the Lord of hosts shall accomplish this.
2 Kings 19:32	For this reason, thus says the Lord about the king of the Assyrians: He shall not enter into this city, nor shoot an arrow into it, nor overtake it with the shield, nor encircle it with fortifications.
2 Kings 19:33	By the way that he came, so shall he return. And he shall not enter this city, says the Lord.
2 Kings 19:34	And I will protect this city, and I will save it for my own sake, and for the sake of my servant David.”
2 Kings 19:35	And so it happened that, in the same night, an Angel of the Lord went and struck down, in the camp of the Assyrians, one hundred and eighty-five thousand. And when he had risen up, at first light, he saw all the bodies of the dead. And withdrawing, he went away.
2 Kings 19:36	And Sennacherib, the king of the Assyrians, returned and dwelled in Nineveh.
2 Kings 19:37	And while he was worshipping in the temple of his god, Nisroch, his sons, Adram-melech and Sharezer, struck him with the sword. And they fled into the land of the Armenians. And Esarhaddon, his son, reigned in his place.
2 Kings 20:1	In those days, Hezekiah was sick unto death. And the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz, came and said to him: “Thus says the Lord God: Instruct your house, for you will die, and not live.”
2 Kings 20:2	And he turned his face to the wall, and he prayed to the Lord, saying:
2 Kings 20:3	“I beg you, O Lord, I beseech you, remember how I have walked before you in truth, and with a perfect heart, and how I have done what is pleasing before you.” And then Hezekiah wept with a great weeping.
2 Kings 20:4	And before Isaiah departed from the middle part of the atrium, the word of the Lord came to him, saying:
2 Kings 20:5	“Return and tell Hezekiah, the leader of my people: Thus says the Lord, the God of your father David: I have heard your prayer, and I have seen your tears. And behold, I have healed you. On the third day, you shall ascend to the temple of the Lord.
2 Kings 20:6	And I will add fifteen years to your days. Then too, I will free you and this city from the hand of the king of the Assyrians. And I will protect this city for my own sake, and for the sake of my servant David.”
2 Kings 20:7	And Isaiah said, “Bring me a mass of figs.” And when they had brought it, and they had placed it on his sore, he was healed.
2 Kings 20:8	But Hezekiah had said to Isaiah, “What will be the sign that the Lord will heal me, and that I will ascend to the temple of the Lord on the third day?”
2 Kings 20:9	And Isaiah said to him: “This will be the sign from the Lord, that the Lord will do the word that he has spoken: Do you wish that the shadow may ascend ten lines, or that it may turn back for the same number of degrees?”
2 Kings 20:10	And Hezekiah said: “It is an easy for the shadow to increase for ten lines. And so I do not wish that this be done. Instead, let it turn back for ten degrees.”
2 Kings 20:11	And so the prophet Isaiah called upon the Lord. And he led back the shadow, along the lines by which it had already descended on the sundial of Ahaz, in reverse for ten degrees.
2 Kings 20:12	At that time, Merodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, the king of the Babylonians, sent letters and gifts to Hezekiah. For he had heard that Hezekiah had been ill.
2 Kings 20:13	Now Hezekiah rejoiced at their arrival, and so he revealed to them the house of aromatic spices, and the gold and silver, and the various pigments and ointments, and the house of his vessels, and all that he was able to have in his treasuries. There was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominions, that Hezekiah did not show to them.
2 Kings 20:14	Then the prophet Isaiah came to king Hezekiah, and said to him: “What did these men say? And from where did they come to you?” And Hezekiah said to him, “They came to me from Babylon, from a far away land.”
2 Kings 20:15	And he responded, “What did they see in your house?” And Hezekiah said: “They saw all things whatsoever that are in my house. There is nothing in my treasuries that I did not show to them.”
2 Kings 20:16	And so Isaiah said to Hezekiah: “Listen to the word of the Lord.
2 Kings 20:17	Behold, the days are coming when all that is in your house, and all that your fathers have stored up even to this day, will be carried away to Babylon. Nothing at all shall remain, says the Lord.
2 Kings 20:18	Then too, they will take from your sons, who will go forth from you, whom you will conceive. And they will be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.”
2 Kings 20:19	Hezekiah said to Isaiah: “The word of the Lord, which you have spoken, is good. Let peace and truth be in my days.”
2 Kings 20:20	Now the rest of the words of Hezekiah, and all his strength, and how he made a pool, and an aqueduct, and how he brought waters into the city, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings 20:21	And Hezekiah slept with his fathers. And Manasseh, his son, reigned in his place.
2 Kings 21:1	Manasseh was twelve years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for fifty-five years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Hephzibah.
2 Kings 21:2	And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, in accord with the idols of the nations that the Lord destroyed before the face of the sons of Israel.
2 Kings 21:3	And he turned away. And he built up the high places that his father, Hezekiah, had destroyed. And he erected altars to Baal, and he made sacred groves, just as Ahab, the king of Israel, had done. And he adored the entire army of heaven, and he served them.
2 Kings 21:4	And he constructed altars in the house of the Lord, about which the Lord said: “In Jerusalem, I will place my name.”
2 Kings 21:5	And he constructed altars, for the entire army of heaven, within the two courts of the temple of the Lord.
2 Kings 21:6	And he led his son through fire. And he used divinations, and observed omens, and appointed soothsayers, and multiplied diviners, so that he did evil before the Lord, and provoked him.
2 Kings 21:7	Also, he set up an idol, of the sacred grove that he had made, in the temple of the Lord, about which the Lord said to David, and to his son Solomon: “In this temple, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will place my name forever.
2 Kings 21:8	And I will no longer cause the feet of Israel to be moved from the land that I gave to their fathers: if only they will take care to do all that I have instructed them, and the entire law that my servant Moses commanded to them.”
2 Kings 21:9	Yet truly, they did not listen. Instead, they were seduced by Manasseh, so that they did evil, more so than the nations that the Lord crushed before the face of the sons of Israel.
2 Kings 21:10	And so the Lord spoke, by the hand of his servants, the prophets, saying:
2 Kings 21:11	“Since Manasseh, the king of Judah, has committed these wicked abominations, beyond all that the Amorites before him have done, and also has caused Judah to sin by his defilements,
2 Kings 21:12	because of this, thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Behold, I will lead evils over Jerusalem and over Judah, such that, whoever will hear of these things, both his ears will ring.
2 Kings 21:13	And I will extend the measuring line of Samaria over Jerusalem, with the scale of the house of Ahab. And I will erase Jerusalem, just as writing tablets are usually erased. And after erasing, I will turn it and repeatedly drag a stylus over its surface.
2 Kings 21:14	And truly, I will send away the remnants of my inheritance, and I will deliver them into the hands of their enemies. And they will be devastated and plundered by all their adversaries.
2 Kings 21:15	For they have done evil before me, and they have persevered in provoking me, from the day when their fathers departed from Egypt, even to this day.
2 Kings 21:16	Moreover, Manasseh also has shed an exceedingly great amount of innocent blood, until he filled Jerusalem even to the mouth, aside from his sins by which he caused Judah to sin, so that they did evil before the Lord.”
2 Kings 21:17	Now the rest of the words of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings 21:18	And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza. And Amon, his son, reigned in his place.
2 Kings 21:19	Amon was twenty-two years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for two years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz, from Jotbah.
2 Kings 21:20	And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, just as his father, Manasseh, had done.
2 Kings 21:21	And he walked in all the ways in which his father had walked. And he served the unclean things that his father had served, and he adored them.
2 Kings 21:22	And he abandoned the Lord, the God of his fathers, and he did not walk in the way of the Lord.
2 Kings 21:23	And his servants undertook treachery against him. And they killed the king in his own house.
2 Kings 21:24	But the people of the land slew all those who had conspired against king Amon. And they appointed for themselves Josiah, his son, as king in his place.
2 Kings 21:25	But the rest of the words of Amon, which he did, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings 21:26	And they buried him in his sepulcher, in the garden of Uzza. And his son, Josiah, reigned in his place.
2 Kings 22:1	Josiah was eight years old when he had begun to reign. He reigned for thirty-one years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah, from Bozkath.
2 Kings 22:2	And he did what was pleasing before the Lord, and he walked in all the ways of his father David. He did not turn aside to the right, or to the left.
2 Kings 22:3	Then, in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, the king sent Shaphan, the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe of the temple of the Lord, saying to him:
2 Kings 22:4	“Go to Hilkiah, the high priest, so that the money may be put together which has been brought into the temple of the Lord, which the doorkeepers of the temple have collected from the people.
2 Kings 22:5	And let it be given, by those in charge of the house of the Lord, to the workers. And let them distribute it to those who are working in the temple of the Lord in order to repair the surfaces of the temple,
2 Kings 22:6	specifically, to carpenters and masons, and to those who mend gaps, and so that wood may be purchased, and stones from the quarries, in order to repair the temple of the Lord.
2 Kings 22:7	Yet truly, let no account be given by them of the money that they receive. Instead, let them have it within their power and trust.”
2 Kings 22:8	Then Hilkiah, the high priest, said to Shaphan, the scribe, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord.” And Hilkiah gave the volume to Shaphan, and he read it.
2 Kings 22:9	Also, Shaphan, the scribe, went to the king, and reported to him what he had instructed. And he said: “Your servants have brought together the money which was found in the house of the Lord. And they have given it so that it would be distributed to the workers by the overseers of the works of the temple of the Lord.”
2 Kings 22:10	Also, Shaphan, the scribe, explained to the king, saying, “Hilkiah, the priest, gave the book to me.” And when Shaphan had read it before the king,
2 Kings 22:11	and the king had heard the words of the book of the law of the Lord, he tore his garments.
2 Kings 22:12	And he instructed Hilkiah, the priest, and Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, and Achbor, the son of Micaiah, and Shaphan, the scribe, and Asaiah, the servant of the king, saying:
2 Kings 22:13	“Go and consult the Lord concerning me, and the people, and all of Judah, about the words of this volume which has been found. For the great wrath of the Lord has been kindled against us because our fathers did not listen to the words of this book, so that they would do all that has been written for us.”
2 Kings 22:14	Therefore, Hilkiah, the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah, went to Huldah, the prophetess, the wife of Shallum, the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, the keeper of the vestments, who was living in Jerusalem, in the second part. And they spoke with her.
2 Kings 22:15	And she responded to them: “Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Tell the man who sent you to me:
2 Kings 22:16	Thus says the Lord: Behold, I will lead evils over this place, and over its inhabitants, all the words of the law that the king of Judah has read.
2 Kings 22:17	For they have abandoned me, and they have sacrificed to foreign gods, provoking me by all the works of their hands. And so my indignation will be kindled against this place. And it will not be extinguished.
2 Kings 22:18	But to the king of Judah, who sent you so that you would consult the Lord, so shall you say: Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: In so far as you have heard the words of the volume,
2 Kings 22:19	and your heart was terrified, and you humbled yourself before the Lord, listening to the words against this place and its inhabitants, specifically, that they would become an astonishment and a curse, and because you have torn your garments, and have wept before me: I also have heard you, says the Lord.
2 Kings 22:20	For this reason, I will gather you to your fathers, and you will be gathered to your sepulcher in peace, so that your eyes may not see all the evils that I will bring over this place.”
2 Kings 23:1	And they reported to the king what she had said. And he sent, and all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem were gathered to him.
2 Kings 23:2	And the king ascended to the temple of the Lord. And with him were all the men of Judah and all who were living in Jerusalem: the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, from the small to the great. And in the hearing of everyone, he read all the words of the book of the covenant, which was found in the house of the Lord.
2 Kings 23:3	And the king stood upon the step. And he struck a covenant before the Lord, so that they would walk after the Lord, and keep his precepts and testimonies and ceremonies, with all their heart and with all their soul, and so that they would carry out the words of this covenant, which had been written in that book. And the people agreed to the covenant.
2 Kings 23:4	And the king instructed Hilkiah, the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the doorkeepers, so that they would cast out of the temple of the Lord all the vessels which had been made for Baal, and for the sacred grove, and for the entire army of heaven. And he burned them outside of Jerusalem, in the steep valley of Kidron. And he carried their dust into Bethel.
2 Kings 23:5	And he destroyed the soothsayers, whom the kings of Judah had appointed to sacrifice in the high places throughout the cities of Judah, and all around Jerusalem, along with those who were burning incense to Baal, and to the Sun, and to the Moon, and to the twelve signs, and to the entire army of heaven.
2 Kings 23:6	And he caused the sacred grove to be carried away from the house of the Lord, outside of Jerusalem, to the steep valley of Kidron. And he burned it there, and reduced it to dust. And he cast the dust over the graves of the common people.
2 Kings 23:7	Also, he destroyed the small places of the effeminate, which were in the house of the Lord, for which the women were weaving something like little houses in the sacred grove.
2 Kings 23:8	And he gathered together all the priests from the cities of Judah. And he defiled the high places, where the priests were sacrificing, from Geba as far as Beersheba. And he tore down the altars of the gates at the entrance to the gate of Joshua, the leader of the city, which was to the left of the gate of the city.
2 Kings 23:9	Yet truly, the priests of the high places did not ascend to the altar of the Lord in Jerusalem. For they would only eat from the unleavened bread in the midst of their brothers.
2 Kings 23:10	Also, he defiled Topheth, which is in the steep valley of the son of Hinnom, so that no one would consecrate his son or his daughter, through fire, to Molech.
2 Kings 23:11	Also, he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the Sun, at the entrance to the temple of the Lord, beside the hallway of Nathan-melech, the eunuch, who was in Pharurim. And he burned the chariots of the Sun with fire.
2 Kings 23:12	Also, the altars which were upon the roof of the upper room of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the temple of the Lord, the king destroyed. And he hurried from there, and he scattered their ashes into the torrent Kidron.
2 Kings 23:13	Also, the high places which were in Jerusalem, to the right side of the Mount of Offense, which Solomon, the king of Israel, had built to Ashtoreth, the idol of the Sidonians, and to Chemosh, the offense of Moab, and to Milcom, the abomination of the sons of Ammon, the king defiled.
2 Kings 23:14	And he crushed the statues, and he cut down the sacred groves. And he filled their places with the bones of the dead.
2 Kings 23:15	Then too, the altar which was in Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin, had made: both that altar and the high place he tore down, and burned, and reduced to dust. And then he also set fire to the sacred grove.
2 Kings 23:16	And in that place Josiah, turning, saw the sepulchers which were on the mount. And he sent and took the bones from the sepulchers. And he burned them upon the altar, and he defiled it in accord with the word of the Lord, which was spoken by the man of God, who had predicted these events.
2 Kings 23:17	And he said, “What is that monument that I see?” And the citizens of that city responded to him: “It is the sepulcher of the man of God, who came from Judah, and who predicted these events, which you have carried out concerning the altar of Bethel.”
2 Kings 23:18	And he said: “Permit him. Let no one move his bones.” And his bones have remained untouched, with the bones of the prophet who had arrived from Samaria.
2 Kings 23:19	Then too, all the shines of the high places, which were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the Lord, Josiah took away. And he acted toward them according to all the works that he had done in Bethel.
2 Kings 23:20	And all the priests of the high places, who were in that place, he killed upon the altars. And he burned the bones of the men upon them. And he returned to Jerusalem.
2 Kings 23:21	And he instructed all the people, saying: “Keep the Passover to the Lord your God, according to what has been written in the book of this covenant.”
2 Kings 23:22	Now no similar Passover was kept, from the days of the judges, who judged Israel, and from all the days of the kings of Israel and the kings of Judah,
2 Kings 23:23	as this Passover, which was kept to the Lord in Jerusalem, in the eighteenth year of king Josiah.
2 Kings 23:24	Then too, Josiah took away those who divined by spirits, and the soothsayers, and the images of the idols, and the defilements, and the abominations, which had been in the land of Judah and Jerusalem, so that he might establish the words of the law, which were written in the book, which Hilkiah, the priest, found in the temple of the Lord.
2 Kings 23:25	There was no king before him similar to him, who returned to the Lord with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his strength, in accord with the entire law of Moses. And after him, there rose up no one similar to him.
2 Kings 23:26	Yet truly, the Lord did not turn away from the wrath of his great fury, his fury which was enraged against Judah because of the provocations by which Manasseh had provoked him.
2 Kings 23:27	And so the Lord said: “And now I will remove Judah from my face, just as I removed Israel. And I will cast aside this city, Jerusalem, which I have chosen, and the house, about which I said: My name shall be there.”
2 Kings 23:28	Now the rest of the words of Josiah, and all that he did, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Judah?
2 Kings 23:29	During his days, Pharaoh Neco, the king of Egypt, ascended against the king of the Assyrians to the river Euphrates. And king Josiah went out to meet him. And when he had seen him, he was killed at Megiddo.
2 Kings 23:30	And his servants carried him dead from Megiddo. And they took him to Jerusalem, and they buried him in his own sepulcher. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz, the son of Josiah. And they anointed him, and made him king in place of his father.
2 Kings 23:31	Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for three months in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah, from Libnah.
2 Kings 23:32	And he did evil before the Lord, according to all that his fathers had done.
2 Kings 23:33	And Pharaoh Neco bound him at Riblah, which is in the land of Hamath, so that he would not reign in Jerusalem. And he imposed a penalty on the land: one hundred talents of silver, and one talent of gold.
2 Kings 23:34	And Pharaoh Neco appointed Eliakim, the son of Josiah, as king in place of Josiah his father. And he changed his name to Jehoiakim. Then he took Jehoahaz away, and he brought him into Egypt, and there he died.
2 Kings 23:35	Now Jehoiakim gave silver and gold to Pharaoh, when he had taxed the land, according to each one who would contribute by the command of Pharaoh. And he exacted both silver and gold from the people of the land, from each one according to his ability, so that he would give to Pharaoh Neco.
2 Kings 23:36	Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for eleven years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Zebidah, the daughter of Pedaiah, from Rumah.
2 Kings 23:37	And he did evil before the Lord, in accord with all that his fathers had done.
2 Kings 24:1	During his days, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, ascended, and Jehoiakim became his servant for three years. And again he rebelled against him.
2 Kings 24:2	And the Lord sent to him the robbers of the Chaldeans, and the robbers of Syria, and the robbers of Moab, and the robbers of the sons of Ammon. And he sent them into Judah, so that they might destroy it, in accord with the word of the Lord, which he had spoken through his servants, the prophets.
2 Kings 24:3	Then this occurred, by the word of the Lord against Judah, that he took him away from before himself because of all the sins of Manasseh which he did,
2 Kings 24:4	and because of the innocent blood which he shed, and because he filled Jerusalem with the slaughter of the innocent. And for this reason, the Lord was not willing to be appeased.
2 Kings 24:5	But the rest of the words of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Judah? And Jehoiakim slept with his fathers.
2 Kings 24:6	And Jehoiachin, his son, reigned in his place.
2 Kings 24:7	And the king of Egypt no longer continued to go out from his own land. For the king of Babylon had taken all that had belonged to the king of Egypt, from the river of Egypt as far as the river Euphrates.
2 Kings 24:8	Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for three months in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan, from Jerusalem.
2 Kings 24:9	And he did evil before the Lord, in accord with all that his father had done.
2 Kings 24:10	At that time, the servants of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, ascended against Jerusalem. And the city was encircled with fortifications.
2 Kings 24:11	And Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, went to the city, with his servants, so that he might fight against it.
2 Kings 24:12	And Jehoiachin, the king of Judah, went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his leaders, and his eunuchs. And the king of Babylon received him, in the eighth year of his reign.
2 Kings 24:13	And he took from there all the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the house of the king. And he cut up all the gold vessels which Solomon, the king of Israel, had made for the temple of the Lord, in accord with the word of the Lord.
2 Kings 24:14	And he carried away all of Jerusalem, and all the leaders, and all the strong men of the army, ten thousand, into captivity, with every artisan and craftsman. And no one was left behind, except the poor among the people of the land.
2 Kings 24:15	Also, he carried away Jehoiachin into Babylon, and the mother of the king, and the wives of the king, and his eunuchs. And he led into captivity the judges of the land, from Jerusalem to Babylon,
2 Kings 24:16	and all the robust men, seven thousand, and the artisans and craftsman, one thousand: all who were strong men and fit for war. And the king of Babylon led them away as captives, into Babylon.
2 Kings 24:17	And he appointed Mattaniah, his uncle, in his place. And he imposed the name Zedekiah upon him.
2 Kings 24:18	Zedekiah held twenty-one years of life when he had begun to reign. And he reigned for eleven years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah, from Libnah.
2 Kings 24:19	And he did evil before the Lord, in accord with all that Jehoiakim had done.
2 Kings 24:20	For the Lord was angry against Jerusalem and against Judah, until he cast them away from his face. And so Zedekiah withdrew from the king of Babylon.
2 Kings 25:1	Then it happened that, in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, he and his entire army, arrived against Jerusalem. And they encircled it, and they constructed fortifications all around it.
2 Kings 25:2	And the city was enclosed and besieged, even until the eleventh year of king Zedekiah,
2 Kings 25:3	on the ninth day of the month. And a famine prevailed in the city; neither was there bread for the people of the land.
2 Kings 25:4	And the city was breached. And all the men of war fled in the night along the way of the gate which is between the double wall at the garden of the king. Now the Chaldeans were besieging the city on all sides. And so Zedekiah fled along the way which leads to the plains of the wilderness.
2 Kings 25:5	And the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and they overtook him in the plains of Jericho. And all the warriors who were with him were dispersed, and they abandoned him.
2 Kings 25:6	Therefore, having apprehended him, they led the king to the king of Babylon at Riblah. And he was speaking with him in judgment.
2 Kings 25:7	Then he killed the sons of Zedekiah before him, and he dug out his eyes, and he bound him with chains, and he led him away to Babylon.
2 Kings 25:8	In the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, the same is the nineteenth year of the king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan, the leader of the army, a servant of the king of Babylon, went into Jerusalem.
2 Kings 25:9	And he set fire to the house of the Lord, and to the house of the king. And the houses of Jerusalem, and every great house, he burned with fire.
2 Kings 25:10	And the entire army of the Chaldeans, which was with the leader of the military, tore down the walls of Jerusalem all around.
2 Kings 25:11	Then Nebuzaradan, the leader of the military, carried away the rest of the people, who had remained in the city, and the fugitives, who had fled over to the king of Babylon, and the remnant of the common people.
2 Kings 25:12	But he left behind some vinedressers and farmers from the poor of the land.
2 Kings 25:13	Now the pillars of brass which were in the temple of the Lord, and the bases, and the sea of brass, which was in the house of the Lord, the Chaldeans broke apart. And they took all the brass to Babylon.
2 Kings 25:14	Also, they took away the cooking pots of brass, and the scoops, and the forks, and the cups, and the little mortars, and all the articles of brass with which they were ministering.
2 Kings 25:15	And the leader of the military even took away the censers and the bowls, whatever was of gold for the gold, and whatever was of silver for the silver,
2 Kings 25:16	and also the two pillars, the one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made for the temple of the Lord. The brass of all these items was beyond measure.
2 Kings 25:17	One pillar had eighteen cubits in height. And the head of brass upon it was three cubits in height. And the network and pomegranates upon the head of the pillar were all of brass. And the second pillar had a similar adornment.
2 Kings 25:18	Also, the leader of the military took away Seraiah, the chief priest, and Zephaniah, the second priest, and three doorkeepers,
2 Kings 25:19	and from the city, one eunuch, who was in charge of the men of war, and five men out of those who had stood before the king, whom he found in the city, and Sopher, the leader of the army who trained the young soldiers from the people of the land, and sixty men from the common people, who had been found in the city.
2 Kings 25:20	Taking them, Nebuzaradan, the leader of the military, led them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
2 Kings 25:21	And the king of Babylon struck them and killed them at Riblah, in the land of Hamath. And Judah was taken away from his land.
2 Kings 25:22	But over the people who had remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, had permitted, he appointed as ruler Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan.
2 Kings 25:23	And when all the commanders of the military had heard this, they and the men who were with them, specifically, that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah, they went to Gedaliah at Mizpah: Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan, the son of Kareah, and Seraiah, the son of Tanhumeth, the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah, the son of a Maacathite, they and their companions.
2 Kings 25:24	And Gedaliah swore to them and to their companions, saying: “Do not be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Remain in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.”
2 Kings 25:25	But it happened that, in the seventh month, Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of royal offspring, and ten men with him, went and struck Gedaliah, who then died, along with the Jews and the Chaldeans who were with him at Mizpah.
2 Kings 25:26	And all the people, from small to great, and the leaders of the military, rising up, went away to Egypt, fearing the Chaldeans.
2 Kings 25:27	Truly, it happened that, in the thirty-seventh year of the transmigration of Jehoiachin, the king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, Evilmerodach, the king of Babylon, in the year when he had begun to reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin, the king of Judah, from prison.
2 Kings 25:28	And he spoke kindly to him. And he set his throne above the throne of the kings who were with him at Babylon.
2 Kings 25:29	And he changed his garments that he had worn in prison. And he ate bread before him always, during all the days of his life.
2 Kings 25:30	Also, he appointed to him an allowance without ceasing, which also was given to him by the king, for each day, during all the days of his life.

1 Chronicles 11:19	saying: “Far be it from me, that I would do this in the sight of my God, and that I would drink the blood of these men.

1 Chronicles 12:4	Also, there was Ishmaiah, from Gibeon, the strongest among the thirty and over the thirty; Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and Jozabad, from Gederah;
1 Chronicles 12:5	and Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealiah, and Shemariah, and Shephatiah, the Haruphites;
1 Chronicles 12:6	Elkanah, and Isshiah, and Azarel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam, from Carehim;
1 Chronicles 12:7	and also Joelah and Zebadiah, sons of Jeroham, from Gedor.
1 Chronicles 12:8	Then too, from Gad, there went over to David, when he was hiding in the desert, very robust men, who were excellent fighters, taking hold of shield and spear; their faces were like the faces of a lion, and they were swift like the roe deer upon the mountains.
1 Chronicles 12:9	Ezer was the leader, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,
1 Chronicles 12:10	Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,
1 Chronicles 12:11	Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,
1 Chronicles 12:12	Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,
1 Chronicles 12:13	Jeremiah the tenth, Machbannai the eleventh.
1 Chronicles 12:14	These were from the sons of Gad, leaders of the army. The least was in charge of one hundred soldiers, and the greatest was in charge of one thousand.
1 Chronicles 12:15	These are the ones who crossed over the Jordan in the first month, when it is accustomed to overflow its banks. And they put to flight all those who were staying in the valleys, to the eastern region and to the west.
1 Chronicles 12:16	Then some from Benjamin and from Judah also arrived at the stronghold where David was staying.
1 Chronicles 12:17	And David went out to meet them, and he said: “If you have arrived peacefully, so as to be a help to me, may my heart be joined to you; but if to betray me to my adversaries, though I have no iniquity in my hands, may the God of our fathers see and judge.”
1 Chronicles 12:18	Truly, the Spirit clothed Amasai, the leader among the thirty, and he said: “O David, we are yours! O son of Jesse, we are for you! Peace, peace to you, and peace to your helpers. For your God helps you.” Therefore, David received them, and he appointed them as leaders of troops.
1 Chronicles 12:19	Moreover, some from Manasseh crossed over to David, when he went forth with the Philistines against Saul, so that he might fight. But he did not fight with them. For the leaders of the Philistines, taking counsel, sent him back, saying, “To the peril of our own heads, he will return to his lord, Saul.”
1 Chronicles 12:20	And so, when he returned to Ziklag, some fled over to him from Manasseh: Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Adnah, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zillethai, leaders of thousands in Manasseh.
1 Chronicles 12:21	These offered assistance to David against the robbers. For all were very strong men, and they became leaders in the army.
1 Chronicles 12:22	Then, too, some came to David throughout each day, in order to help him, until they became a great number, like the army of God.
1 Chronicles 12:23	Now this is the number of the leaders of the army who went to David when he was at Hebron, so that they might transfer the kingdom of Saul to him, in accord with the word of the Lord:
1 Chronicles 12:24	the sons of Judah, carrying shield and spear, six thousand eight hundred, equipped for battle;
1 Chronicles 12:25	from the sons of Simeon, very strong men for the fight, seven thousand one hundred;
1 Chronicles 12:26	from the sons of Levi, four thousand six hundred;
1 Chronicles 12:27	as well as Jehoiada, a leader from the stock of Aaron, and with him three thousand seven hundred;
1 Chronicles 12:28	and then Zadok, a youth of distinguished qualities, and the house of his father, twenty-two leaders;
1 Chronicles 12:29	and from the sons of Benjamin, brothers of Saul, three thousand, for still a great part of them were following the house of Saul.
1 Chronicles 12:30	Then from the sons of Ephraim, there were twenty thousand eight hundred, very strong and robust men, renowned among their kindred.
1 Chronicles 12:31	And out of the one half tribe of Manasseh, eighteen thousand, each by their names, went forth so that they might appoint David as king.
1 Chronicles 12:32	Also, from the sons of Issachar, there were learned men, who knew each of the times, in order to anticipate what Israel ought to do, two hundred leaders. And all the remainder of the tribe were following their counsel.
1 Chronicles 12:33	Then, from Zebulun, there were those who went forth to battle, and who were standing in a battle line, prepared with the weapons of warfare; these fifty thousand arrived to assist, without duplicity of heart.
1 Chronicles 12:34	And from Naphtali, there were one thousand leaders; and with them were thirty-seven thousand, prepared with shield and spear.
1 Chronicles 12:35	And then from Dan, there were twenty-eight thousand six hundred, ready for battle.
1 Chronicles 12:36	And from Asher, there were forty thousand, going forth to fight, and summoned to the battle line.
1 Chronicles 12:37	Then, across the Jordan, there were, from the sons of Reuben, and from Gad, and from the one half tribe of Manasseh, one hundred twenty thousand, prepared with the weapons of warfare.
1 Chronicles 12:38	All these men of war, equipped for the fight, went with a perfect heart to Hebron, so that they might appoint David as king over all of Israel. Then, too, all the remainder of Israel were of one heart, so that they might make David king.
1 Chronicles 12:39	And they were in that place with David for three days, eating and drinking. For their brothers had made preparations for them.
1 Chronicles 12:40	Moreover, those who were near to them, even as far as Issachar, and Zebulun, and Naphtali, were bringing, on donkeys and camels and mules and oxen, bread for their provisions, with grain, dried figs, dried grapes, wine, oil, and oxen and sheep, with all abundance. For indeed, there was joy in Israel.
1 Chronicles 13:1	Then David took counsel with the tribunes, and the centurions, and all the leaders.
1 Chronicles 13:2	And he said to the entire assembly of Israel: “If it pleases you, and if the words that I speak come from the Lord our God, let us send to the remainder of our brothers, in all the regions of Israel, and to the priests and Levites who live in the suburbs of the cities, so that they may gather to us.
1 Chronicles 13:3	And let us bring back the ark of our God to us. For we did not seek it during the days of Saul.”
1 Chronicles 13:4	And the entire multitude responded that it should be done. For the word had pleased all the people.
1 Chronicles 13:5	Therefore, David gathered all of Israel, from Shihor of Egypt even to the entrance of Hamath, so as to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim.
1 Chronicles 13:6	And David ascended with all the men of Israel to the hill of Kiriath-jearim, which is in Judah, so that he might bring from there the ark of the Lord God, sitting upon the Cherubim, where his name is invoked.
1 Chronicles 13:7	And they placed the ark of God upon a new cart from the house of Abinadab. Then Uzzah and his brother drove the cart.
1 Chronicles 13:8	Now David and all of Israel were playing before God, with all of their ability, in songs, and with harps, and psalteries, and timbrels, and cymbals, and trumpets.
1 Chronicles 13:9	And when they had arrived at the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzzah reached out his hand, so that he might support the ark. For indeed, the ox being wanton had caused it to incline a little.
1 Chronicles 13:10	And so the Lord became angry against Uzzah. And he struck him down because he had touched the ark. And he died there before the Lord.
1 Chronicles 13:11	And David was greatly saddened because the Lord had divided Uzzah. And he called that place ‘the Division of Uzzah,’ even to the present day.
1 Chronicles 13:12	And then he feared God, at that time, saying: “How will I be able to bring in the ark of God to myself?”
1 Chronicles 13:13	And for this reason, he did not bring it to himself, that is, into the City of David. Instead, he turned aside to the house of Obededom, the Gittite.
1 Chronicles 13:14	Therefore, the ark of God dwelt in the house of Obededom for three months. And the Lord blessed his house and all that he had.
1 Chronicles 14:1	Also, Hiram, the king of Tyre, sent messengers to David, and cedar wood, and artisans of walls and of wood, so that they might build a house for him.
1 Chronicles 14:2	And David realized that the Lord had confirmed him as king over Israel, and that his kingdom had been lifted up over his people Israel.
1 Chronicles 14:3	Also, David took other wives in Jerusalem. And he conceived sons and daughters.
1 Chronicles 14:4	And these are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua and Shobab, Nathan and Solomon,
1 Chronicles 14:5	Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpelet,
1 Chronicles 14:6	as well as Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,
1 Chronicles 14:7	Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphelet.
1 Chronicles 14:8	Then, hearing that David had been anointed as king over all of Israel, all the Philistines ascended so that they might seek him. But when David had heard of it, he went out to meet them.
1 Chronicles 14:9	Now the Philistines, arriving, spread out in the Valley of the Rephaim.
1 Chronicles 14:10	And so David consulted the Lord, saying, “Shall I ascend to the Philistines, and will you deliver them into my hand?” And the Lord said to him, “Ascend, and I will deliver them into your hand.”
1 Chronicles 14:11	And when they had ascended to Baal-perazim, David struck them there, and he said: “God has divided my enemies by my hand, just as waters are divided.” And therefore the name of that place was called Baal-perazim.
1 Chronicles 14:12	And they left behind their gods in that place, and so David ordered them to be burned.
1 Chronicles 14:13	And then, at another time, the Philistines invaded, and they spread out in the valley.
1 Chronicles 14:14	And again, David consulted God. And God said to him: “You shall not ascend after them. Draw away from them. And you shall come against them opposite the balsam trees.
1 Chronicles 14:15	And when you hear a sound approaching in the tops of the balsam trees, then you shall go forth to war. For God has gone forth before you, so that he may strike down the army of the Philistines.”
1 Chronicles 14:16	Therefore, David did just as God had instructed him. And he struck down the army of the Philistines, from Gibeon as far as Gazera.
1 Chronicles 14:17	And the name of David became well-known in all the regions. And the Lord placed the fear of him over all the nations.
1 Chronicles 15:1	Also, he made houses for himself in the City of David. And built a place for the ark of God, and he set up a tent for it.
1 Chronicles 15:2	Then David said: “It is illicit for anyone to carry the ark of God except the Levites, whom the Lord chose to carry it and to minister to himself, even unto eternity.”
1 Chronicles 15:3	And he gathered all of Israel in Jerusalem, so that the ark of God might be brought into its place, which he had prepared for it.
1 Chronicles 15:4	Certainly, there were both the sons of Aaron and the Levites:
1 Chronicles 15:5	From the sons of Kohath, Uriel was the leader, and his brothers were one hundred twenty.
1 Chronicles 15:6	From the sons of Merari: Asaiah was the leader, and his brothers were two hundred twenty.
1 Chronicles 15:7	From the sons of Gershom: Joel was the leader, and his brothers were one hundred thirty.
1 Chronicles 15:8	From the sons of Elizaphan: Shemaiah was the leader, and his brothers were two hundred.
1 Chronicles 15:9	From the sons of Hebron: Eliel was the leader, and his brothers were eighty.
1 Chronicles 15:10	From the sons of Uzziel: Amminadab was the leader, and his brothers were one hundred twelve.
1 Chronicles 15:11	And David summoned the priests, Zadok and Abiathar, and the Levites: Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab.
1 Chronicles 15:12	And he said to them: “You who are the leaders of the Levitical families, be sanctified with your brothers, and bring the ark of the Lord God of Israel to the place that has been prepared for it.
1 Chronicles 15:13	Otherwise, as it was before, when the Lord struck us because you were not present, so also it might be now, if we do what is illicit.”
1 Chronicles 15:14	Therefore, the priests and the Levites were sanctified, so that they might carry the ark of the Lord God of Israel.
1 Chronicles 15:15	And the sons of Levi took the ark of God, just as Moses had instructed, in accord with the word of the Lord, upon their shoulders by the bars.
1 Chronicles 15:16	And David spoke to the leaders of the Levites, so that they might appoint, from their brothers, singers with musical instruments, specifically, psalteries, and harps, and cymbals, so that a joyful noise might resound on high.
1 Chronicles 15:17	And they appointed from the Levites: Heman, the son of Joel; and from his brothers, Asaph, the son of Berechiah; and truly, from their brothers, the sons of Merari: Ethan, the son of Kushaiah.
1 Chronicles 15:18	And with them were their brothers in the second rank: Zechariah, and Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jahiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, who were gatekeepers.
1 Chronicles 15:19	Now the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were sounding out with cymbals of brass.
1 Chronicles 15:20	And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah were singing mysteries with the psalteries.
1 Chronicles 15:21	Then Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah and Obededom, and Jeiel and Azaziah were singing a song of victory with the harps, for the octave.
1 Chronicles 15:22	Now Chenaniah, the leader of the Levites, was foremost over the prophecies, in order to mark out in advance the melodies. For indeed, he was very skillful.
1 Chronicles 15:23	And Berechiah and Elkanah were porters of the ark.
1 Chronicles 15:24	And the priests, Shebaniah, and Joshaphat, and Nethanel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, were sounding the trumpets before the ark of God. And Obededom and Jehiah were porters of the ark.
1 Chronicles 15:25	Therefore, David, and all those greater by birth of Israel, and the tribunes, went to carry the ark of the covenant of the Lord from the house of Obededom with rejoicing.
1 Chronicles 15:26	And when God had assisted the Levites, who were carrying the ark of the covenant of the Lord, they immolated seven bulls and seven rams.
1 Chronicles 15:27	Now David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who were carrying the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah, the leader of the prophecy among the singers. But David was also clothed with a linen ephod.
1 Chronicles 15:28	And all of Israel were leading back the ark of the covenant of the Lord with jubilation, sounding out with the noise of horns, and trumpets, and cymbals, and psalteries, and harps.
1 Chronicles 15:29	And when the ark of the covenant of the Lord had arrived in the City of David, Michal, the daughter of Saul, gazing through a window, saw king David dancing and playing, and she despised him in her heart.
1 Chronicles 16:1	And so they took the ark of God, and they set it in the midst of the tabernacle, which David had pitched for it. And they offered holocausts and peace offerings before God.
1 Chronicles 16:2	And when David had completed offering holocausts and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord.
1 Chronicles 16:3	And he divided to every single one, from men even to women, a twist of bread, and a piece of roasted beef, and fine wheat flour fried with oil.
1 Chronicles 16:4	And he appointed some from the Levites who would minister before the ark of the Lord, and commemorate his works, and glorify and praise the Lord, the God of Israel.
1 Chronicles 16:5	Asaph was the leader, and second to him was Zechariah. In addition, there were Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obededom. And Jeiel was over the instruments of the psaltery and the harps. But Asaph sounded out with the cymbals.
1 Chronicles 16:6	Truly, the priests, Benaiah and Jahaziel, were to sound the trumpet continually before the ark of the covenant of the Lord.
1 Chronicles 16:7	In that day, David made Asaph the leader, in order to confess to the Lord with his brothers:
1 Chronicles 16:8	“Confess to the Lord, and invoke his name. Make known his endeavors among the peoples.
1 Chronicles 16:9	Sing to him, and sing psalms to him, and describe all his miracles.
1 Chronicles 16:10	Praise his holy name! Let the heart of those who seek the Lord rejoice!
1 Chronicles 16:11	Seek the Lord and his virtue. Seek his face always.
1 Chronicles 16:12	Remember his miracles, which he has accomplished, his signs, and the judgments of his mouth.
1 Chronicles 16:13	O offspring of Israel, his servants! O sons of Jacob, his elect!
1 Chronicles 16:14	He is the Lord our God. His judgments are throughout all the earth.
1 Chronicles 16:15	Remember forever his covenant, the word that he instructed unto a thousand generations,
1 Chronicles 16:16	the covenant that he formed with Abraham, and his oath with Isaac.
1 Chronicles 16:17	And he appointed the same to Jacob as a precept, and to Israel as an everlasting pact,
1 Chronicles 16:18	saying: ‘To you, I will give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance.’
1 Chronicles 16:19	At that time, they were small in number, they were few and were settlers there.
1 Chronicles 16:20	And they passed through, from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people.
1 Chronicles 16:21	He did not permit anyone to falsely accuse them. Instead, he reproved kings on their behalf:
1 Chronicles 16:22	‘Do not touch my Christ. And do not malign my prophets.’
1 Chronicles 16:23	Sing to the Lord, all the earth! Announce his salvation, from day to day.
1 Chronicles 16:24	Describe his glory among the Gentiles, his miracles among all the peoples.
1 Chronicles 16:25	For the Lord is great and exceedingly praiseworthy. And he is terrible, above all gods.
1 Chronicles 16:26	For all the gods of the peoples are idols. But the Lord made the heavens.
1 Chronicles 16:27	Confession and magnificence are before him. Strength and gladness are in his place.
1 Chronicles 16:28	Bring to the Lord, O families of the peoples, bring to the Lord glory and dominion.
1 Chronicles 16:29	Give glory to the Lord, to his name. Lift up sacrifice, and approach before his sight. And adore the Lord in holy attire.
1 Chronicles 16:30	Let all the earth be moved before his face. For he founded the globe immoveable.
1 Chronicles 16:31	Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth exult. And let them say among the nations, ‘The Lord has reigned.’
1 Chronicles 16:32	Let the sea roar, with all its plenitude. Let the fields exult, with all that is in them.
1 Chronicles 16:33	Then the trees of the forest will give praise before the Lord. For he comes to judge the earth.
1 Chronicles 16:34	Confess to the Lord, for he is good. For his mercy is eternal.
1 Chronicles 16:35	And say: ‘Save us, O God our savior! And gather us together, and rescue us from the nations, so that we may confess to your holy name, and may exult in your songs.
1 Chronicles 16:36	Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, from eternity to eternity.’ And let all the people say, ‘Amen,’ and let them sing a hymn to the Lord.”
1 Chronicles 16:37	And so, there before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, he left Asaph and his brothers, so that they might minister in the sight of the ark continually, throughout each day, and in their turns.
1 Chronicles 16:38	Now Obededom and his brothers were sixty-eight. And he appointed Obededom, the son of Jeduthun, and Hosah to be porters.
1 Chronicles 16:39	But Zadok the priest, and his brothers the priests, were before the tabernacle of the Lord in the high place, which was in Gibeon,
1 Chronicles 16:40	so that they could offer holocausts to the Lord upon the altar of holocausts continually, morning and evening, according to all that was written in the law of the Lord, which he instructed to Israel.
1 Chronicles 16:41	And after him, Heman, and Jeduthun, and the remainder of the elect, each one by his name, were appointed to confess to the Lord: “For his mercy endures forever.”
1 Chronicles 16:42	Also Heman and Jeduthun sounded the trumpet, and they played upon the cymbals, and upon every kind of musical instrument, in order to sing praises to God. But the sons of Jeduthun he made to be porters.
1 Chronicles 16:43	And all the people returned to their houses, and David also, so that he might bless his own house too.
1 Chronicles 17:1	Now when David was living in his house, he said to the prophet Nathan: “Behold, I live in a house of cedar. But the ark of the covenant of the Lord is under tent skins.”
1 Chronicles 17:2	And Nathan said to David: “Do all that is in your heart. For God is with you.”
1 Chronicles 17:3	And yet, that night the word of God came to Nathan, saying:
1 Chronicles 17:4	“Go, and speak to my servant David: Thus says the Lord: You shall not build a house for me as a dwelling place.
1 Chronicles 17:5	For I have not stayed in a house from the time when I led out Israel, even to this day. Instead, I have been continually changing places, in a tabernacle and tent,
1 Chronicles 17:6	dwelling with all of Israel. When did I ever speak to any one at all, among the judges of Israel whom I placed in charge so that they might pasture my people, saying: ‘Why have you not built a house of cedar for me?’
1 Chronicles 17:7	And so, now you shall say this to my servant David: Thus says the Lord of hosts: I took you when you were following the flock in the pastures, so that you would be the leader of my people Israel.
1 Chronicles 17:8	And I have been with you wherever you have gone. And I have slain all your enemies before you, and I have made a name for you like one of the great ones who are celebrated upon the earth.
1 Chronicles 17:9	And I have given a place to my people Israel. They shall be planted, and they shall live in it, and they shall no longer be moved. Neither shall the sons of iniquity wear them away, as in the beginning,
1 Chronicles 17:10	from the days when I gave judges to my people Israel, and I humbled all your enemies. Therefore, I announce to you that the Lord will build a house for you.
1 Chronicles 17:11	And when you will have completed your days, so that you go to your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall be from your sons. And I will establish his kingdom.
1 Chronicles 17:12	He shall build a house for me, and I will make firm his throne, even unto eternity.
1 Chronicles 17:13	I will be a father to him, and he shall be a son to me. And I will not take away my mercy from him, as I took it away from the one who was before you.
1 Chronicles 17:14	And I will station him in my house and in my kingdom, even forever. And his throne will be very firm, in perpetuity.”
1 Chronicles 17:15	According to all these words, and according to this entire vision, so did Nathan speak to David.
1 Chronicles 17:16	And when king David had departed, and had sat down before the Lord, he said: “Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my house, that you would grant such things to me?
1 Chronicles 17:17	But even this has seemed little in your sight, and therefore you have also spoken about the house of your servant even for the future. And you have made me a spectacle above all men, O Lord God.
1 Chronicles 17:18	What more can David add, since you have so glorified your servant, and have known him?
1 Chronicles 17:19	O Lord, because of your servant, in accord with your own heart, you have brought about all this magnificence, and you have willed all these great things to be known.
1 Chronicles 17:20	O Lord, there is no one like you. And there is no other God apart from you, out of all whom we have heard about with our ears.
1 Chronicles 17:21	For what other single nation upon earth is like your people Israel, to whom God reached out, so that he might free them, and might make a people for himself, and by his greatness and terribleness cast out the nations before the face of those whom he had freed from Egypt?
1 Chronicles 17:22	And you have set your people Israel to be your people, even unto eternity. And you, O Lord, have become their God.
1 Chronicles 17:23	Now therefore, O Lord, let the word that you have spoken to your servant, and over his house, be confirmed in perpetuity, and do just as you have spoken.
1 Chronicles 17:24	And may your name remain and be magnified even for all time. And let it be said: ‘The Lord of hosts is the God of Israel. And the house of his servant David remains forever before him.’
1 Chronicles 17:25	For you, O Lord my God, have revealed to the ear of your servant that you will build a house for him. And therefore your servant has found faith so that he might pray before you.
1 Chronicles 17:26	Now then, O Lord, you are God. And you have spoken to your servant such great benefits.
1 Chronicles 17:27	And you have begun to bless the house of your servant, so that it may be always before you. For since it is you who is blessing, O Lord, it shall be blessed forever.”
1 Chronicles 18:1	Now after these things, it happened that David struck the Philistines, and he humbled them, and he took Gath and her daughters from the hand of the Philistines.
1 Chronicles 18:2	And he struck Moab. And the Moabites became the servants of David, offering gifts to him.
1 Chronicles 18:3	In that time, David also struck Hadadezer, the king of Zobah, in the region of Hamath, when he went forth so that he might extend his dominion as far as the river Euphrates.
1 Chronicles 18:4	Then David seized one thousand of his four-horse chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand men on foot. And he hamstrung all the chariot horses, except for one hundred four-horse chariots, which he reserved for himself.
1 Chronicles 18:5	Then the Syrians of Damascus also arrived, so that they might offer assistance to Hadadezer, the king of Zobah. And so, David then struck of them twenty-two thousand men.
1 Chronicles 18:6	And he stationed soldiers in Damascus, so that Syria also would serve him, and would offer gifts. And the Lord assisted him in all the things to which he went forth.
1 Chronicles 18:7	Also, David took the golden quivers, which the servants of Hadadezer had, and he brought them to Jerusalem.
1 Chronicles 18:8	In addition, from Tibhath and Cun, cities of Hadadezer, he brought very much brass, from which Solomon made the sea of brass, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.
1 Chronicles 18:9	Now when Toi, the king of Hamath, had heard this, specifically that David had struck the entire army of Hadadezer, the king of Zobah,
1 Chronicles 18:10	he sent his son Hadoram to king David so that he might petition peace from him, and so that he might congratulate him that he had struck and defeated Hadadezer. For indeed, Toi was an adversary to Hadadezer.
1 Chronicles 18:11	Moreover, all the vessels of gold and silver and brass king David consecrated to the Lord, with the silver and gold that he had taken from all the nations, as much from Idumea, and Moab, and the sons of Ammon, as from the Philistines and Amalek.
1 Chronicles 18:12	Truly, Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, struck eighteen thousand of the Edomites in the Valley of the Salt Pits.
1 Chronicles 18:13	And he stationed a garrison in Edom, so that Idumea would serve David. And the Lord saved David in all the things to which he went forth.
1 Chronicles 18:14	Therefore, David reigned over all of Israel, and he executed judgment and justice among all his people.
1 Chronicles 18:15	Now Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was over the army, and Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, was the keeper of records.
1 Chronicles 18:16	And Zadok, the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech, the son of Abiathar, were the priests. And Shavsha was the scribe.
1 Chronicles 18:17	Also, Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, was over the legions of the Cherethites and Pelethites. But the sons of David were first at the hand of the king.
1 Chronicles 19:1	Now it happened that Nahash, the king of the sons of Ammon, died, and his son reigned in his place.
1 Chronicles 19:2	And David said: “I will act with mercy toward Hanun, the son of Nahash. For his father was gracious to me.” And so David sent messengers to console him over the death of his father. But when they had reached the land of the sons of Ammon, so that they might console Hanun,
1 Chronicles 19:3	the leaders of the sons of Ammon said to Hanun: “Do you think that perhaps David has sent them to console you in order to honor your father? Have you not noticed that his servants came to you so that they might explore, and investigate, and examine your land?”
1 Chronicles 19:4	And so Hanun shaved the heads and beards of the servants of David, and he cut away their tunics from the buttocks to the feet, and he sent them away.
1 Chronicles 19:5	And when they had gone, and had sent word to David, (for they had suffered a great disgrace,) he sent to meet them, and he instructed them that they should remain at Jericho until their beards grew, and then they should return.
1 Chronicles 19:6	Then, when the sons of Ammon realized that they had committed an injury against David, both Hanun and the rest of the people sent one thousand talents of silver, so that they might hire for themselves chariots and horsemen from Mesopotamia, and from Syrian Maacah, and from Zobah.
1 Chronicles 19:7	And they hired thirty-two thousand chariots, and the king of Maacah with his people. When these had arrived, they made camp in the region opposite Medeba. Also, the sons of Ammon, gathering from their cities, went to war.
1 Chronicles 19:8	And when David had heard this, he sent Joab and the entire army of strong men.
1 Chronicles 19:9	And the sons of Ammon, going out, set up a battle line before the gate of the city. But the kings who had come to their aid stood separately in the field.
1 Chronicles 19:10	And so Joab, understanding the war to be set facing him and behind his back, chose the strongest men from all of Israel, and he went out against the Syrians.
1 Chronicles 19:11	But the remaining portion of the people he placed under the hand of his brother Abishai. And they went out against the sons of Ammon.
1 Chronicles 19:12	And he said: “If the Syrians prevail over me, then you shall be a help to me. But if the sons of Ammon prevail over you, I will be a safeguard for you.
1 Chronicles 19:13	Be strengthened, and let us act manfully on behalf of our people, and on behalf of the cities of our God. And the Lord will do what is good in his own sight.”
1 Chronicles 19:14	Therefore, Joab, and the people who were with him, went out to battle against the Syrians. And he put them to flight.
1 Chronicles 19:15	Then the sons of Ammon, seeing that the Syrians had fled, also themselves fled from Abishai, his brother, and they entered into the city. And now Joab returned to Jerusalem.
1 Chronicles 19:16	But the Syrians, seeing that they had fallen before Israel, sent messengers, and they brought the Syrians who were across the river. And Shophach, the leader of the military of Hadadezer, was their commander.
1 Chronicles 19:17	When this had been reported to David, he gathered together all of Israel, and he crossed the Jordan. And he rushed toward them. And he set up a battle line facing them. And they fought against him.
1 Chronicles 19:18	But the Syrians fled from Israel. And David killed of the Syrians seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand men on foot, and Shophach, the leader of the army.
1 Chronicles 19:19	Then the servants of Hadadezer, seeing themselves to be overwhelmed by Israel, crossed over to David, and they served him. And Syria was no longer willing to offer aid to the sons of Ammon.
1 Chronicles 20:1	Now it happened that, after the course of a year, in the time when kings usually go forth to war, Joab gathered an army with experienced soldiers, and he laid waste to the land of the sons of Ammon. And he continued on and besieged Rabbah. But David was staying in Jerusalem when Joab struck Rabbah and destroyed it.
1 Chronicles 20:2	Then David took the crown of Milcom from his head, and he found in it the weight of one talent of gold, and very precious gems. And he made for himself a diadem from it. Also, he took the best spoils of the city, which were very many.
1 Chronicles 20:3	Then he led away the people who were in it. And he caused plows, and sleds, and iron chariots to go over them, so much so that they were cut apart and crushed. So did David treat all the cities of the sons of Ammon. And he returned with all his people to Jerusalem.
1 Chronicles 20:4	After these things, a war was begun at Gezer against the Philistines, in which Sibbecai the Hushathite struck Sippai from the race of the Rephaim, and he humbled them.
1 Chronicles 20:5	Also, another war was undertaken against the Philistines, in which Adeodatus, a son of the forest, a Bethlehemite, struck the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the wood of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.
1 Chronicles 20:6	Then too, another war occurred in Gath, in which there was a very tall man, having six digits, that is, all together twenty-four. This man too was born from the stock of the Rephaim.
1 Chronicles 20:7	He blasphemed Israel. And Jonathan, the son of Shimea, the brother of David, struck him down.
1 Chronicles 20:8	These were the sons of the Rephaim in Gath, who fell by the hand of David and his servants.
1 Chronicles 21:1	Now Satan rose up against Israel, and he incited David so that he would number Israel.
1 Chronicles 21:2	And David said to Joab and to the leaders of the people: “Go, and number Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan. And bring me the number, so that I may know it.”
1 Chronicles 21:3	And Joab responded: “May the Lord increase his people a hundred times more than they are. But, my lord the king, are they not all your servants? Why would my lord seek this thing, which may be imputed as a sin to Israel?”
1 Chronicles 21:4	But the word of the king prevailed instead. And Joab went away, and he traveled around, through all of Israel. And he returned to Jerusalem.
1 Chronicles 21:5	And he gave to David the number of those whom he had surveyed. And the entire number of Israel was found to be one million and one hundred thousand men who could draw the sword; but from Judah, there were four hundred and seventy thousand men of war.
1 Chronicles 21:6	But Levi and Benjamin he did not number. For Joab executed the orders of the king unwillingly.
1 Chronicles 21:7	Then God was displeased with what had been ordered, and so he struck Israel.
1 Chronicles 21:8	And David said to God: “I have sinned exceedingly in doing this. I beg you take away the iniquity of your servant. For I have acted unwisely.”
1 Chronicles 21:9	And the Lord spoke to Gad, the seer of David, saying:
1 Chronicles 21:10	“Go, and speak to David, and tell him: Thus says the Lord: I give to you the option of three things. Choose the one that you will want, and I will do it to you.”
1 Chronicles 21:11	And when Gad had gone to David, he said to him: “Thus says the Lord: Choose what you will want:
1 Chronicles 21:12	Either three years of famine, or three months for you to flee from your enemies, unable to escape from their sword, or three days for the sword of the Lord and a pestilence to turn within the land, with the Angel of the Lord killing in every part of Israel. Now therefore, see what I should respond to him who sent me.”
1 Chronicles 21:13	And David said to Gad: “There are difficulties pressing upon me from every side. But it is better for me to fall into the hands of the Lord, for his mercies are many, than into the hands of men.”
1 Chronicles 21:14	Therefore, the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel. And there fell from Israel seventy thousand men.
1 Chronicles 21:15	Also, he sent an Angel to Jerusalem, so that he might strike it. And while he was striking, the Lord saw and took pity over the magnitude of the harm. And he commanded the Angel who was striking: “It is enough. Now let your hand cease.” And the Angel of the Lord was standing beside the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
1 Chronicles 21:16	And David, lifting up his eyes, saw the Angel of the Lord, standing between heaven and earth with a drawn sword in his hand, turned toward Jerusalem. And both he and those greater by birth, being clothed in haircloth, fell prone upon the ground.
1 Chronicles 21:17	And David said to God: “Am I not the one who ordered that the people be numbered? It is I who sinned; it is I who did evil. This flock, what does it deserve? O Lord my God, I beg you to let your hand be turned against me and against the house of my father. But let not your people be struck down.”
1 Chronicles 21:18	Then the Angel of the Lord instructed Gad to tell David that he should ascend and build an altar to the Lord God on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
1 Chronicles 21:19	Therefore, David ascended, in accord with the word of Gad, which he had spoken to him in the name of the Lord.
1 Chronicles 21:20	Now when Ornan had looked up and seen the Angel, he and his four sons hid themselves. For at that time, he was threshing wheat upon the floor.
1 Chronicles 21:21	Then, as David was approaching Ornan, Ornan saw him, and he went out from the threshing floor to meet him. And he reverenced him prone on the ground.
1 Chronicles 21:22	And David said to him: “Give this place of your threshing floor to me, so that I may build an altar to the Lord upon it. And you shall accept from me as much money as it is worth, so that the plague may cease from the people.”
1 Chronicles 21:23	But Ornan said to David: “Take it, and may my lord the king do whatever pleases him. Moreover, I give the oxen also as a holocaust, and the plow for wood, and the wheat for a sacrifice. I will offer all freely.”
1 Chronicles 21:24	And king David said to him: “By no means shall it be so. Instead, I will give money to you, as much as it is worth. For I must not take it from you, and thereby offer to the Lord holocausts that cost nothing.”
1 Chronicles 21:25	Therefore, David gave Ornan, for the place, the very just weight of six hundred shekels of gold.
1 Chronicles 21:26	And he built an altar to the Lord there. And he offered holocausts and peace offerings, and he called upon the Lord. And he heeded him by sending fire from heaven upon the altar of the holocaust.
1 Chronicles 21:27	And the Lord instructed the Angel, and he turned his sword back into its sheath.
1 Chronicles 21:28	Then, seeing that the Lord had heeded him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, David immediately immolated victims there.
1 Chronicles 21:29	But the tabernacle of the Lord, which Moses had made in the desert, and the altar of holocausts, were at that time on the high place of Gibeon.
1 Chronicles 21:30	And David was unable to go to the altar, so that he might pray to God there. For he had been struck with an exceedingly great fear, seeing the sword of the Angel of the Lord.
1 Chronicles 22:1	And David said, “This is the house of God, and this is the altar for the holocaust of Israel.”
1 Chronicles 22:2	And he instructed them to gather all the new converts from the land of Israel. And from these he appointed stoneworkers, to hew stones and to polish them, so that he might build the house of God.
1 Chronicles 22:3	Also, David prepared very much iron to use for the nails of the gates, and for the seams and joints, as well as an immeasurable weight of brass.
1 Chronicles 22:4	Also, the cedar trees, which the Sidonians and Tyrians had transported to David, were not able to be counted.
1 Chronicles 22:5	And David said: “My son Solomon is a young and tender boy. But the house that I desire to be built to the Lord ought to be so great that it is renowned in every region. Therefore, I will prepare what will be necessary for him.” And for this reason, before his death, he prepared all the expenses.
1 Chronicles 22:6	And he called for Solomon, his son. And he instructed him to build a house to the Lord, the God of Israel.
1 Chronicles 22:7	And David said to Solomon: “My son, it was my will that I build a house to the name of the Lord my God.
1 Chronicles 22:8	But the word of the Lord came to me, saying: ‘You have shed much blood, and you have battled in many wars. You are not able to build a house to my name, so great was the shedding of blood before me.
1 Chronicles 22:9	The son who shall be born to you will be a very quiet man. For I will cause him to have rest from all his enemies on every side. And for this reason, he shall be called Peaceful. And I will grant peace and tranquility to Israel during all his days.
1 Chronicles 22:10	He shall build a house to my name. And he shall be a son to me, and I will be a father to him. And I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel unto eternity.’
1 Chronicles 22:11	Now then, my son, may the Lord be with you, and may you prosper and build a house to the Lord your God, just as he has spoken concerning you.
1 Chronicles 22:12	Also, may the Lord give you prudence and understanding, so that you may be able to rule Israel and to guard the law of the Lord your God.
1 Chronicles 22:13	For then you will be able to advance, if you keep the commandments and judgments that the Lord instructed Moses to teach to Israel. Be strengthened and act manfully. You should not fear, and you should not dread.
1 Chronicles 22:14	Behold, in my poverty I have prepared the expenses for the house of the Lord: one hundred thousand talents of gold, and one million of talents of silver. Yet truly, there is no measuring the brass and the iron. For their magnitude is beyond numbering. And I have prepared the timber and the stones for the entire project.
1 Chronicles 22:15	Also, you have very many artisans: stoneworkers, and builders of walls, and craftsmen of wood, and those most prudent in doing the work of every art,
1 Chronicles 22:16	with gold and silver, and with brass and iron, of which there is no number. Therefore, rise up and act. And the Lord will be with you.”
1 Chronicles 22:17	Also, David instructed all the leaders of Israel, so that they would assist his son Solomon,
1 Chronicles 22:18	saying: “You discern that the Lord your God is with you, and that he has given you rest on all sides, and that he has delivered all your enemies into your hands, and that the land has been subdued before the Lord and before his people.
1 Chronicles 22:19	Therefore, offer your hearts and your souls, so that you seek the Lord your God. And rise up and build a sanctuary to the Lord God, so that the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and the vessels consecrated to the Lord, may be brought into the house that is built to the name of the Lord.”
1 Chronicles 23:1	Then David, being old and full of days, appointed his son Solomon as king over Israel.
1 Chronicles 23:2	And he gathered together all the leaders of Israel, with the priests as well as the Levites.
1 Chronicles 23:3	And the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward. And there were found thirty-eight thousand men.
1 Chronicles 23:4	Of these, twenty-four thousand were chosen and distributed to the ministry of the house of the Lord. Then six thousand were overseers and judges.
1 Chronicles 23:5	Moreover, four thousand were porters. And the same number were the singers of psalms to the Lord, with the musical instruments which he had made for the music.
1 Chronicles 23:6	And David distributed them into courses according to the sons of Levi, specifically, Gershom, and Kohath, and Merari.
1 Chronicles 23:7	The sons of Gershom: Ladan and Shimei.
1 Chronicles 23:8	The sons of Ladan: the leader Jahiel, and Zetham, and Joel, three.
1 Chronicles 23:9	The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the leaders of the families of Ladan.
1 Chronicles 23:10	Then the sons of Shimei: Jahath, and Zizah, and Jeush, and Beriah. These were the sons of Shimei, four.
1 Chronicles 23:11	Now Jahath was first, Zizah second, but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons, and for this reason they were reckoned as one family and one house.
1 Chronicles 23:12	The sons of Kohath: Amram and Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel, four.
1 Chronicles 23:13	The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. Now Aaron was separated so that he might minister in the Holy of Holies, he and his sons forever, and so that he might burn incense to the Lord, according to his rite, and so that he might bless his name in perpetuity.
1 Chronicles 23:14	The sons of Moses, the man of God, were also numbered in the tribe of Levi.
1 Chronicles 23:15	The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.
1 Chronicles 23:16	The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the first.
1 Chronicles 23:17	Now the sons of Eliezer were Rehabiah the first. And there were no other sons for Eliezer. But the sons of Rehabiah were multiplied exceedingly.
1 Chronicles 23:18	The sons of Izhar: Shelomith the first.
1 Chronicles 23:19	The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth.
1 Chronicles 23:20	The sons of Uzziel: Micah the first, Isshiah the second.
1 Chronicles 23:21	The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.
1 Chronicles 23:22	Then Eleazar died, and had no sons, but only daughters. And so the sons of Kish, their brothers, married them.
1 Chronicles 23:23	The sons of Mushi: Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.
1 Chronicles 23:24	These are the sons of Levi, in their kindred and families, leaders in turns, and the number of each of the heads who were doing the works of the ministry of the house of the Lord, from twenty years of age and upward.
1 Chronicles 23:25	For David said: “The Lord, the God of Israel, has given rest to his people, and a habitation in Jerusalem even unto eternity.
1 Chronicles 23:26	Neither shall it be the office of the Levites any more to carry the tabernacle with all its equipment for use in the ministry.”
1 Chronicles 23:27	Also, according to the last precepts of David, the sons of Levi shall be counted by number from twenty years of age and upward.
1 Chronicles 23:28	And they shall be under the hand of the sons of Aaron, in the care of the house of the Lord, in the vestibule, and in the chambers, and in the place of purification, and in the sanctuary, and in all the works of the ministry of the temple of the Lord.
1 Chronicles 23:29	But the priests shall be over the bread of the presence, and the sacrifice of fine wheat flour, and the unleavened cakes, and the frying pan, and the roasting, and over every weight and measure.
1 Chronicles 23:30	Yet truly, the Levites shall stand to confess and to sing to the Lord, in the morning, and similarly in the evening,
1 Chronicles 23:31	as much in the oblation of the holocausts of the Lord, as in the Sabbaths and new moons and other solemnities, according to the number and ceremonies for each and every matter, perpetually before the Lord.
1 Chronicles 23:32	And let them keep the observances of the tabernacle of the covenant, and the rituals of the sanctuary, and the observance of the sons of Aaron, their brothers, so that they may minister in the house of the Lord.
1 Chronicles 24:1	Now these were the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron: Nadab, and Abihu, and Eleazar, and Ithamar.
1 Chronicles 24:2	But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and without children. And so Eleazar and Ithamar exercised the priestly office.
1 Chronicles 24:3	And David distributed them, that is, Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their courses and ministry.
1 Chronicles 24:4	And there were found many more of the sons of Eleazar among the leading men, than of the sons of Ithamar. Therefore, he divided them so that there were, of the sons of Eleazar, sixteen leaders by their families, and of the sons of Ithamar eight by their families and houses.
1 Chronicles 24:5	Then he divided among them, in both families, by lot. For there were leaders of the sanctuary and leaders of God, as much from the sons of Eleazar as from the sons of Ithamar.
1 Chronicles 24:6	And the scribe Shemaiah, the son of Nethanel, a Levite, wrote these down before the king and the leaders, with Zadok, the priest, and Ahimelech, the son of Abiathar, and also the leaders of the priestly and Levitical families. And there was one house, which was preeminent over the others, that of Eleazar; and there was another house, which had the others under it, that of Ithamar.
1 Chronicles 24:7	Now the first lot went forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,
1 Chronicles 24:8	the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,
1 Chronicles 24:9	the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,

1 Chronicles 24:17	the twenty-first to Jachin, the twenty-second to Gamul,
1 Chronicles 24:18	the twenty-third to Delaiah, the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.
1 Chronicles 24:19	These were their courses according to their ministries, so that they would enter into the house of the Lord in accord with their practice, under the hand of Aaron, their father, just as the Lord, the God of Israel, had instructed.
1 Chronicles 24:20	Now of the sons of Levi who were remaining, there were Shubael, from the sons of Amram, and Jehdeiah, from the sons of Shubael.
1 Chronicles 24:21	Also, there were Isshiah, the leader from the sons of Rehabiah,
1 Chronicles 24:22	and truly Shelomoth, the son of Izhar, and Jahath, the son of Shelomoth,
1 Chronicles 24:23	and his son, Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth.
1 Chronicles 24:24	The son of Uzziel was Micah. The son of Micah was Shamir.
1 Chronicles 24:25	The brother of Micah was Isshiah. And the son of Isshiah was Zechariah.
1 Chronicles 24:26	The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. The son of Uzziah was Beno.
1 Chronicles 24:27	Also, the son of Merari: Uzziah, and Shoham, and Zaccur, and Hebri.
1 Chronicles 24:28	In addition, the son of Mahli was Eleazar, who had no children.
1 Chronicles 24:29	Truly, the son of Kish was Jerahmeel.
1 Chronicles 24:30	The sons of Mushi were Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of Levi according to the houses of their families.
1 Chronicles 24:31	And they also cast lots concerning their brothers, the sons of Aaron, before David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the leaders of the priestly and Levitical families, as much concerning the elder as the younger. The lot divided all things equitably.
1 Chronicles 25:1	Then David and the magistrates of the army set apart, for the ministry, the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who were to prophesy with harps and psalteries and cymbals, in accord with their number, having been dedicated to their appointed office.
1 Chronicles 25:2	From the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, and Joseph, and Nethaniah, and Asharelah, the sons of Asaph, under the hand of Asaph, prophesying beside the king.
1 Chronicles 25:3	Then of Jeduthun, the sons of Jeduthun: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, and Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under the hand of their father Jeduthun, who was prophesying with stringed instruments, while confessing and praising the Lord.

1 Chronicles 25:5	All these were the sons of Heman, the seer of the king in the words of God, in order to lift up the horn. And God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.
1 Chronicles 25:6	All these, under their father’s hand, were distributed in order to sing in the temple of the Lord, with cymbals and psalteries and harps, in the ministry of the house of the Lord beside the king, specifically, Asaph, and Jeduthun, and Heman.
1 Chronicles 25:7	Now the number of these, with their brothers, who were instructing in the song of the Lord, all the teachers, were two hundred eighty-eight.
1 Chronicles 25:8	And they cast lots in their turns, the elder equally with the younger, the learned together with the unlearned.

1 Chronicles 26:9	Then there were the sons of Meshelemiah and their brothers, very robust men, eighteen.
1 Chronicles 26:10	Now, from Hosah, that is, from the sons of Merari: Shimri the leader, for he had not had a firstborn son, and so, because of this, his father had appointed him as the leader,
1 Chronicles 26:11	Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, Zechariah the fourth. All these, the sons and brothers of Hosah, were thirteen.
1 Chronicles 26:12	These were distributed as porters, so that the leaders of the posts, as well as their brothers, were ministering continually in the house of the Lord.
1 Chronicles 26:13	Then they cast lots equally, for both the small and the great, by their families, concerning each one of the gates.
1 Chronicles 26:14	And the lot of the east fell out to Shelemiah. But to his son Zechariah, a very prudent and learned man, the northern section was obtained by lot.
1 Chronicles 26:15	Truly, Obededom and his sons obtained that to the south, in the part of the house where the council of elders was.
1 Chronicles 26:16	Shuppim and Hosah obtained that toward the west, beside the gate that leads to the way of the ascent, one post facing the other.
1 Chronicles 26:17	Truly, toward the east there were six Levites, and toward the north there were four per day, and then toward the south similarly there were four each day. And where the council was, there were two and two.
1 Chronicles 26:18	Also, in the cells of the porters toward the west, there were four along the way, and two at every cell.
1 Chronicles 26:19	These are the divisions of the porters of the sons of Kohath and of Merari.
1 Chronicles 26:20	Now Ahijah was over the treasuries of the house of God, and the holy vessels.
1 Chronicles 26:21	The sons of Ladan, sons of Gershon: from Ladan, leaders of the families of Ladan and of Gershon: Jehieli.
1 Chronicles 26:22	The sons of Jehieli: Zetham and Joel; his brothers were over the treasuries of the house of the Lord,
1 Chronicles 26:23	with the Amramites, and Izharites, and Hebronites, and Uzzielites.
1 Chronicles 26:24	Now, Shebuel, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, was in the first place over the treasuries,
1 Chronicles 26:25	along with his brothers, Eliezer, and his son Rehabiah, and his son Jeshaiah, and his son Joram, and also his son Zichri, and his son Shelomoth.
1 Chronicles 26:26	The same Shelomoth and his brothers were over the treasuries of the holy things, which king David sanctified, with the leaders of the families, and the tribunes, and the centurions, and the commanders of the army.
1 Chronicles 26:27	These things were from the wars and from the best spoils of the battles, which they had consecrated for the repair and the furnishing of the temple of the Lord.
1 Chronicles 26:28	Now all these things were sanctified by Samuel, the seer, and by Saul, the son of Kish, and by Abner, the son of Ner, and by Joab, the son of Zeruiah. All those who had sanctified these were under the hand of Shelomoth and his brothers.
1 Chronicles 26:29	Yet truly, Chenaniah and his sons were over the Izharites, for the exterior works concerning Israel, in order to teach and to judge them.
1 Chronicles 26:30	Now from the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brothers, one thousand seven hundred very strong men, were in charge of Israel across the Jordan toward the west, in all the works of the Lord, and in the ministry of the king.
1 Chronicles 26:31	And the leader of the Hebronites was Jerijah, according to their families and kindred. In the fortieth year of the reign of David, they were numbered, and there were found very strong men in Jazer Gilead.
1 Chronicles 26:32	And his brothers of a mature age were two thousand seven hundred leaders of families. Then king David placed them in charge of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the one half tribe of Manasseh, in all of the ministries of God and of the king.
1 Chronicles 27:1	Now the sons of Israel, according to their number, the leaders of the families, the tribunes, and the centurions, and the chiefs, who were ministering to the king by their companies, entering and departing in each month of the year as they were in charge, were twenty-four thousand.
1 Chronicles 27:2	Jashobeam, the son of Zabdiel, was in charge of the first company in the first month; and under him were twenty-four thousand.
1 Chronicles 27:3	He was from the sons of Perez, and he was the leader of all the other leaders in the army, in the first month.
1 Chronicles 27:4	The company of the second month had Dodai, an Ahohite; and after him there was another, named Mikloth, who ruled over a portion of the army of the twenty-four thousand.
1 Chronicles 27:5	Also, the commander of the third company, in the third month, was Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada the priest; and in his division there were twenty-four thousand.
1 Chronicles 27:6	The same is the Benaiah who was strongest among the thirty, and was above the thirty. But his son, Ammizabad, was in charge of his company.
1 Chronicles 27:7	The fourth, for the fourth month, was Asahel, the brother of Joab, and his son Zebadiah after him; and in his company there were twenty-four thousand.
1 Chronicles 27:8	The fifth leader, for the fifth month, was Shamhuth, an Izrahite; and in his company there were twenty-four thousand.

1 Chronicles 27:11	The eighth, for the eighth month, was Sibbecai, a Hushathite from the stock of the Zerahites; and in his company there were twenty-four thousand.

1 Chronicles 27:15	The twelfth, for the twelfth month, was Heldai, a Netophathite from the stock of Othniel; and in his company there were twenty-four thousand.
1 Chronicles 27:16	Now those who were first over the tribes of Israel were these: over the Reubenites, Eliezer, the son of Zichri, was the ruler; over the Simeonites, Shephatiah, the son of Maacah, was the ruler;
1 Chronicles 27:17	over the Levites, Hashabiah, the son of Kemuel; over the Aaronites, Zadok;
1 Chronicles 27:18	over Judah, Elihu, the brother of David; over Issachar, Omri, the son of Michael;
1 Chronicles 27:19	over the Zebulunites, Ishmaiah, the son of Obadiah; over the Naphtalites, Jeremoth, the son of Azriel;
1 Chronicles 27:20	over the sons of Ephraim, Hoshea, the son of Azaziah; over the one half tribe of Manasseh, Joel, the son of Pedaiah;
1 Chronicles 27:21	and over the one half tribe of Manasseh in Gilead, Iddo, the son of Zechariah; then over Benjamin, Jaasiel, the son of Abner;
1 Chronicles 27:22	yet truly, Azarel, the son of Jeroham, was over Dan. These were the leaders of the sons of Israel.
1 Chronicles 27:23	But David was not willing to number them from twenty years old and under. For the Lord had said that he would multiply Israel like the stars of heaven.
1 Chronicles 27:24	Joab, the son of Zeruiah, had begun to number, but he did not finish. For because of this, wrath had fallen upon Israel. And therefore the number of those who had been counted was not related in the official records of king David.
1 Chronicles 27:25	Now over the storerooms of the king was Azmaveth, the son of Adiel. But Jonathan, the son of Uzziah, was over those storerooms that were in the cities, and in the villages, and in the towers.
1 Chronicles 27:26	And over the farmlands and the farmers, those who worked the ground, was Ezri, the son of Chelub.
1 Chronicles 27:27	And over the cultivators of vineyards was Shimei, a Ramathite; then over the wine cellars was Zabdi, an Aphonite.
1 Chronicles 27:28	Now over the olive groves and the fig groves, which were in the plains, was Baal-hanan, a Gederite; and over the oil cellars was Joash.
1 Chronicles 27:29	Now over the herds that were pastured in Sharon, Shitrai, a Sharonite, was in the first place; and over the oxen in the valleys, there was Shaphat, the son of Adlai.
1 Chronicles 27:30	Truly, over the camels was Obil, an Ishmaelite; and over the donkeys was Jehdeiah, a Meronothite.
1 Chronicles 27:31	And over the sheep was Jaziz, a Hagarene. All these were leaders over the substance of king David.
1 Chronicles 27:32	Now Jonathan, the uncle of David, was a counselor, a prudent and scholarly man; he and Jehiel, the son of Hachmoni, were with the sons of the king.
1 Chronicles 27:33	Now Ahithophel was the counselor of the king; and Hushai, the Archite, was the king’s friend.
1 Chronicles 27:34	After Ahithophel was Jehoiada, the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar. But the leader of the army of the king was Joab.
1 Chronicles 28:1	And so David called together all the leaders of Israel, the rulers of the tribes, and those in charge of the companies, who were ministering to the king, and also the tribunes and centurions, and those in charge of the substance and possessions of the king, and his sons, with the eunuchs and the powerful and those most experienced in the army, at Jerusalem.
1 Chronicles 28:2	And when the king had risen up and was standing, he said: “Listen to me, my brothers and my people. I thought that I would build a house, in which the ark of the covenant of the Lord, the footstool of our God, might rest. And so I prepared everything for its building.
1 Chronicles 28:3	But God said to me: ‘You shall not build a house to my name, because you are a man of war, and have shed blood.’
1 Chronicles 28:4	Now the Lord God of Israel chose me, out of the entire house of my father, so that I would be king over Israel forever. For from Judah he chose leaders; then from the house of Judah he chose the house of my father; and from the sons of my father, it pleased him to choose me as king over all of Israel.
1 Chronicles 28:5	Then too, among my sons (for the Lord has given me many sons) he chose Solomon my son, so that he would sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the Lord, over Israel.
1 Chronicles 28:6	And he said to me: ‘Solomon your son shall build my house and my courts. For I have chosen him to be to me as a son, and I will be to him as a father.
1 Chronicles 28:7	And I will make firm his kingdom, even unto eternity, if he will persevere in doing my precepts and judgments, as also today.’
1 Chronicles 28:8	Now therefore, before the entire assembly of Israel, in the hearing of our God, keep and seek all the commandments of the Lord our God, so that you may possess the good land, and may bequeath it to your sons after you, even forever.
1 Chronicles 28:9	And as for you, my son Solomon, know the God of your father, and serve him with a perfect heart and a willing mind. For the Lord searches all hearts, and understands the thoughts of all minds. If you seek him, you will find him. But if you abandon him, he will cast you aside for eternity.
1 Chronicles 28:10	Now therefore, since the Lord has chosen you, so that you would build the house of the Sanctuary, be strengthened and accomplish it.”
1 Chronicles 28:11	Then David gave to his son Solomon a description of the portico, and the temple, and the storerooms, and the upper floor, and the innermost rooms, and the house of propitiation,
1 Chronicles 28:12	and indeed also of all the courts that he had planned, and the outer rooms on all sides, for the treasuries of the house of the Lord, and for the treasuries of the holy things,
1 Chronicles 28:13	and for the divisions of the priests and the Levites: concerning all the works of the house of the Lord and all the items in the ministry of the temple of the Lord.
1 Chronicles 28:14	There was gold by weight for every vessel of the ministry, and also silver by weight for the diversity of vessels and equipment.
1 Chronicles 28:15	Then too, he distributed gold for the lampstands and their lamps, according to the measure of each of the lampstands with their lamps. Similarly also, he distributed silver by weight for the silver lampstands with their lamps, according to the diversity of their measure.
1 Chronicles 28:16	Also, he gave gold for the tables of the presence, according to the diversity of the tables; similarly too, he gave silver for the other tables of silver.
1 Chronicles 28:17	Also, he distributed from the purest gold for the small hooks and the bowls and the censors, as well as for the little lions of gold, in accord with the precise measure of the weight, for lion after lion. Similarly too, for the lions of silver, he set aside a different weight of silver.
1 Chronicles 28:18	Then, for the altar on which the incense was burned, he gave the purest gold. And from the same he made the likeness of the chariot of the Cherubim, with extended wings, which is veiling the ark of the covenant of the Lord.
1 Chronicles 28:19	“All these things,” he said, “came to me written by the hand of the Lord, so that I would understand all the works of the pattern.”
1 Chronicles 28:20	David also said to his son Solomon: “Act manfully, and be strengthened, and carry it out. You should not be afraid, and you should not be dismayed. For the Lord my God will be with you, and he will not send you away, nor will he abandon you, until you have perfected the entire work of the ministry of the house of the Lord.
1 Chronicles 28:21	Behold, the divisions of the priests and the Levites, for every ministry of the house of the Lord, are standing before you. And they have been prepared, and so they know, both the leaders and the people, how to carry out all your precepts.”
1 Chronicles 29:1	And king David spoke to the entire assembly: “My son Solomon, the one God has chosen, is still a tender boy. And yet the work is great, for a habitation is being prepared, not for man, but for God.
1 Chronicles 29:2	Now with all my ability, I have prepared the expenses for the house of my God: gold for items of gold, and silver for those of silver, brass for those of brass, iron for those of iron, and wood for those of wood, and stones of onyx, and stones like alabaster, and stones of diverse colors, and every kind of precious stone, and marble from Paros in great abundance.
1 Chronicles 29:3	And in addition to these things that I have offered into the house of my God, I give, from my own belongings, gold and silver for the temple of my God, aside from those things that I have prepared for the holy shrine:
1 Chronicles 29:4	three thousand talents of gold, from the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of highly-refined silver, for the gilding of the walls of the temple;
1 Chronicles 29:5	and gold for wherever there is need of gold, and silver for wherever there is need of silver, for the works to be done by the hands of the artisans. And if anyone freely offers, let him fill his hand this day, and let him offer whatever he wishes to the Lord.”
1 Chronicles 29:6	And so the leaders of the families, and the nobles of the tribes of Israel, as well as the tribunes and the centurions and the overseers of the king’s possessions, promised
1 Chronicles 29:7	and gave, for the works of the house of the Lord, five thousand talents and ten thousand pieces of gold, ten thousand talents of silver, and eighteen thousand talents of brass, and also one hundred thousand talents of iron.
1 Chronicles 29:8	And whoever found precious stones among their belongings gave them to the treasuries of the house of the Lord, by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.
1 Chronicles 29:9	And the people rejoiced, since they were promising their votive offerings willingly. For they were offering these to the Lord with all their heart. And king David also rejoiced with great gladness.
1 Chronicles 29:10	And he blessed the Lord before the entire multitude, and he said: “Blessed are you, O Lord God of Israel, our Father from eternity to eternity.
1 Chronicles 29:11	Yours, O Lord, is magnificence and power and glory, and also victory; and to you is praise. For all the things that are in heaven and on earth are yours. Yours is the kingdom, O Lord, and you are above all rulers.
1 Chronicles 29:12	Yours is wealth, and yours is glory. You have dominion over all things. In your hand is virtue and power. In your hand is greatness and authority over all things.
1 Chronicles 29:13	Now therefore, we confess to you, our God, and we praise your famous name.
1 Chronicles 29:14	Who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to promise all these things to you? All is yours. And so the things that we received from your hand, we have given to you.
1 Chronicles 29:15	For we are sojourners and new arrivals before you, as all our fathers were. Our days upon the earth are like a shadow, and there is no delay.
1 Chronicles 29:16	O Lord our God, all this abundance, which we have prepared so that a house may be built to your holy name, is from your hand, and all things are yours.
1 Chronicles 29:17	I know, my God, that you test hearts, and that you love simplicity. Therefore, in the simplicity of my heart, I also have offered all these things joyfully. And I have seen, with immense gladness, your people, who have been found here, offering their donations to you.
1 Chronicles 29:18	O Lord, the God of our fathers Abraham and Isaac and Israel, preserve unto eternity this desire of their heart, and let this purpose remain forever, for the worship of you.
1 Chronicles 29:19	Also, I give to my son Solomon a perfect heart, so that he may keep your commandments, your testimonies, and your ceremonies, and so that he may accomplish all things, and may build the temple, for which I have prepared the expenses.”
1 Chronicles 29:20	Then David instructed the entire assembly: “Bless the Lord our God.” And the entire assembly blessed the Lord, the God of their fathers. And they bowed themselves, and they adored God, and next they reverenced the king.
1 Chronicles 29:21	And they immolated victims to the Lord. And they offered holocausts on the following day: one thousand bulls, one thousand rams, one thousand lambs, with their libations and with every ritual, very abundantly, for all of Israel.
1 Chronicles 29:22	And they ate and drank before the Lord on that day, with great rejoicing. And they anointed Solomon, the son of David, a second time. And they anointed him to the Lord as the ruler, and Zadok as the high priest.
1 Chronicles 29:23	And Solomon sat upon the throne of the Lord as king, in place of his father David, and it pleased everyone. And all of Israel obeyed him.
1 Chronicles 29:24	Moreover, all the leaders, and the powerful, and all the sons of king David pledged with their hand, and they became subject to king Solomon.
1 Chronicles 29:25	Then the Lord magnified Solomon over all of Israel. And he gave to him a glorious reign, of a kind such as no one has had before him, as king of Israel.
1 Chronicles 29:26	Now David, the son of Jesse, reigned over all of Israel.
1 Chronicles 29:27	And the days during which he reigned over Israel were forty years. He reigned seven years in Hebron, and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.
1 Chronicles 29:28	And he died at a good old age, full of days and wealth and glory. And his son Solomon reigned in his place.
1 Chronicles 29:29	Now the acts of king David, from the first to the last, have been written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,
1 Chronicles 29:30	concerning his entire reign and strength, and the times that passed under him, both in Israel and in all the kingdoms of the lands.
2 Chronicles 1:1	Then Solomon, the son of David, was strengthened in his reign, and the Lord his God was with him, and he magnified him on high.
2 Chronicles 1:2	And Solomon instructed the whole of Israel, the tribunes, and the centurions, and the rulers, and the judges over all of Israel, and the leaders of the families.
2 Chronicles 1:3	And he went away with the entire multitude to the high place of Gibeon, where the tabernacle of the covenant of the Lord was, which Moses, the servant of God, made in the wilderness.
2 Chronicles 1:4	For David had brought the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim, to the place that he had prepared for it, and where he had pitched a tabernacle for it, that is, in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 1:5	Also, the altar of brass, which Bezalel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had constructed, was there before the tabernacle of the Lord. And so Solomon sought it, with the entire assembly.
2 Chronicles 1:6	And Solomon ascended to the bronze altar, before the tabernacle of the covenant of the Lord, and he offered upon it one thousand victims.
2 Chronicles 1:7	But behold, during that night God appeared to him, saying, “Request what you wish, so that I may give it to you.”
2 Chronicles 1:8	And Solomon said to God: “You have shown great mercy to my father David. And you have appointed me as king in his place.
2 Chronicles 1:9	Now therefore, O Lord God, let your word be fulfilled, which you promised to my father David. For you have made me king over your great people, who are as innumerable as the dust of the earth.
2 Chronicles 1:10	Give to me wisdom and understanding, so that I may enter and depart before your people. For who is able worthily to judge this, your people, who are so great?”
2 Chronicles 1:11	Then God said to Solomon: “Since this is the choice that pleased your heart, and you did not request wealth and substance and glory, nor the lives of those who hate you, nor even many days of life, since instead you requested wisdom and knowledge so that you may be able to judge my people, over whom I have appointed you as king:
2 Chronicles 1:12	wisdom and knowledge are granted to you. And I will give to you wealth and substance and glory, so that none of the kings either before you or after you will be similar to you.”
2 Chronicles 1:13	Then Solomon went from the high place of Gibeon to Jerusalem, before the tabernacle of the covenant, and he reigned over Israel.
2 Chronicles 1:14	And he gathered to himself chariots and horsemen. And they brought to him one thousand four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. And he caused them to be in the cities of the chariots, and with the king in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 1:15	And the king offered silver and gold in Jerusalem as if they were stones, and cedar trees as if they were sycamores, which grow in the plains in a great multitude.
2 Chronicles 1:16	Then horses were brought to him from Egypt and from Kue, by the negotiators of the king, who went and bought for a price:
2 Chronicles 1:17	a four-horse chariot for six hundred pieces of silver, and a horse for one hundred fifty. A similar offer to purchase was made known among all the kingdoms of the Hittites, and among the kings of Syria.
2 Chronicles 2:1	And Solomon resolved to build a house to the name of the Lord, and a palace for himself.
2 Chronicles 2:2	And he numbered seventy thousand men to carry upon shoulders, and eighty thousand who were hewing stones in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred as their overseers.
2 Chronicles 2:3	Also, he sent to Hiram, the king of Tyre, saying: “Just as you did for my father David, when you sent him cedar wood, so that he might build a house for himself, in which he then lived,
2 Chronicles 2:4	do so also for me, so that I may build a house to the name of the Lord my God, so that I may consecrate it for the burning of incense before him, and for the smoke of aromatics, and for the perpetual bread of the presence, and for the holocausts, in morning and in evening, as well as on the Sabbaths and new moons and solemnities of the Lord our God forever, which have been commanded to Israel.
2 Chronicles 2:5	For the house that I desire to build is great. For our God is great, above all gods.
2 Chronicles 2:6	So then, who will be able prevail, so that he may build a worthy house for him? If heaven and the heavens of heavens cannot contain him, what am I that I would be able to build a house to him? But let it be for this only, so that incense may be burned before him.
2 Chronicles 2:7	Therefore, send to me a learned man, who knows how to work with gold and silver, with brass and iron, with purple, scarlet, and hyacinth, and who knows how to carve engravings, along with these artisans that I have with me in Judea and Jerusalem, whom my father David has prepared.
2 Chronicles 2:8	Then too, send to me cedar wood, and juniper, and pine from Lebanon. For I know that your servants know how to cut timber from Lebanon, and my servants will be with your servants,
2 Chronicles 2:9	so that very much wood may be prepared for me. For the house that I desire to build is exceedingly great and glorious.
2 Chronicles 2:10	In addition, I will give to your servants, the workers who will cut down the trees, for provisions: twenty thousand cor of wheat, and the same number of cor of barley, and twenty thousand measures of wine, as well as twenty thousand good measures of oil.”
2 Chronicles 2:11	Then Hiram, the king of Tyre, said, by a letter that had been sent to Solomon: “Because the Lord loved his people, for this reason he appointed you to reign over them.”
2 Chronicles 2:12	And he added, saying: “Blessed is the Lord, the God of Israel, who made heaven and earth, who gave to king David a son who is wise, and learned, and intelligent as well as prudent, so that he may build a house to the Lord, and a palace for himself.
2 Chronicles 2:13	Therefore, I have sent my father Hiram to you; he is a prudent and very knowledgeable man,
2 Chronicles 2:14	the son of a woman from the daughters of Dan, whose father was a Tyrian, who knows how to work with gold and silver, with brass and iron, and with marble and timber, as well as with purple, and hyacinth, and fine linen, and scarlet. And he knows how to carve every kind of engraving, and how to devise prudently whatever may be necessary to the work, with your artisans and with the artisans of my lord David, your father.
2 Chronicles 2:15	Therefore, send the wheat and barley and oil and wine, which you, my lord, have promised, to your own servants.
2 Chronicles 2:16	Then we will cut down as much wood from Lebanon as you will need, and we will convey them as rafts by sea to Joppa. Then it will be for you to transfer them to Jerusalem.”
2 Chronicles 2:17	And so Solomon numbered all the new converts who were in the land of Israel, after the numbering that David his father had done, and they were found to be one hundred fifty thousand and three thousand six hundred.
2 Chronicles 2:18	And he appointed seventy thousand of them, who would carry burdens on shoulders, and eighty thousand who would hew stones in the mountains, then three thousand and six hundred as overseers of the work of the people.
2 Chronicles 3:1	And Solomon began to build the house of the Lord, in Jerusalem on mount Moriah, as it had been shown to David his father, at the place which David had prepared on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
2 Chronicles 3:2	Now he began to build in the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.
2 Chronicles 3:3	And these are the foundations, which Solomon set forth so that he might build the house of God: the length in cubits by the first measure sixty, the width in cubits twenty.
2 Chronicles 3:4	Truly, at the front, the portico, which was extended in length according to the measure of the width of the house, was of twenty cubits. Then the height was of one hundred twenty cubits. And he overlaid it on the interior with the purest gold.
2 Chronicles 3:5	Also, he covered the greater house with wooden panels of spruce, and he affixed layers of refined gold through it all. And he engraved in them palm trees, and the likeness of little chains interlaced with one another.
2 Chronicles 3:6	Also, he paved the floor of the temple with the most precious marble, of great beauty.
2 Chronicles 3:7	Now the gold, with which he covered in layers the house and its beams and posts and walls and doors, was highly refined. And he engraved cherubim on the walls.
2 Chronicles 3:8	Also, he made the house of the Holy of Holies. Its length, in accord with the width of the temple, was of twenty cubits. And its width, similarly, was of twenty cubits. And he covered it with layers of gold, of about six hundred talents.
2 Chronicles 3:9	Then he also made nails of gold, such that each nail weighed fifty shekels. Also, he covered the upper rooms in gold.
2 Chronicles 3:10	Now he also made, in the house of the Holy of Holies, two cherubim as a work of statues. And he covered them with gold.
2 Chronicles 3:11	The wings of the cherubim extended for twenty cubits, such that one wing had five cubits and it touched the wall of the house, and the other, having five cubits, touched the wing of the other cherub.
2 Chronicles 3:12	Similarly, the wing of the other cherub was five cubits, and it touched the wall, and his other wing of five cubits also touched the wing of the other cherub.
2 Chronicles 3:13	And so the wings of both cherubim were stretched out and extended for twenty cubits. Now they were standing upright on their feet, and their faces were turned toward the exterior house.
2 Chronicles 3:14	Also, he made a veil from hyacinth, purple, scarlet, and fine linen. And he wove within it cherubim.
2 Chronicles 3:15	And also, before the doors of the temple, there were two pillars, having a height of thirty-five cubits. But their heads were of five cubits.
2 Chronicles 3:16	Then too, there were something like little chains on the oracle, and he placed these upon the heads of the pillars. And there were one hundred pomegranates, which he placed between the little chains.
2 Chronicles 3:17	Also, he placed these pillars in the vestibule of the temple, one to the right, and the other to the left. The one that was on the right, he called Jachin; and the one that was on the left, Boaz.
2 Chronicles 4:1	Also, he made a brass altar of twenty cubits in length, and of twenty cubits in width, and of ten cubits in height,
2 Chronicles 4:2	as well as a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in its circumference. It had five cubits in height, and a line of thirty cubits went around it on all sides.
2 Chronicles 4:3	Also, under it there was the likeness of oxen. And certain engravings encircled the cavity of the sea, along ten cubits of the outside, as if in two rows. Now the oxen were molten.
2 Chronicles 4:4	And the sea itself was placed upon the twelve oxen, three of which were looking toward the north, and another three toward the west, then another three toward the south, and the three that remained toward the east, having the sea imposed upon them. But the posteriors of the oxen were toward the interior, under the sea.
2 Chronicles 4:5	Now its thickness had the measure of the palm of a hand, and its brim was like the lip of a cup, or like the outturned petal of a lily. And it held three thousand measures.
2 Chronicles 4:6	Also, he made ten basins. And he placed five on the right, and five on the left, so that they might wash in them all the things that they were to offer as holocausts. But the priests were to be washed in the sea.
2 Chronicles 4:7	Then he also made ten gold lampstands, according to the form by which they had been ordered to be made. And he set them in the temple, five on the right, and five on the left.
2 Chronicles 4:8	Moreover, there were also ten tables. And he placed them in the temple, five on the right, and five on the left. Also, there were one hundred gold bowls.
2 Chronicles 4:9	Then too, he made the court of the priests, and a great hall, and doors in the hall, which he covered with brass.
2 Chronicles 4:10	Now he placed the sea on the right side, facing the east, toward the south.
2 Chronicles 4:11	Then Hiram made cooking pots and hooks and bowls. And he completed every work of the king in the house of God,
2 Chronicles 4:12	that is, the two pillars, and the crossbeams, and the heads, and something like a little net, which would cover the heads above the crossbeams,
2 Chronicles 4:13	and also four hundred pomegranates, and two little nets, so that two rows of pomegranates were joined to each net, which would cover the crossbeams and the heads of the pillars.
2 Chronicles 4:14	He also made bases; and basins that he placed upon the bases;
2 Chronicles 4:15	one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;
2 Chronicles 4:16	and cooking pots and hooks and bowls. Hiram, his father, made all the vessels for Solomon, in the house of the Lord, from the purest brass.
2 Chronicles 4:17	The king cast these in the region near the Jordan, in the clay soil between Succoth and Zeredah.
2 Chronicles 4:18	Now the multitude of the vessels was innumerable, so much so that the weight of the brass was unknown.
2 Chronicles 4:19	And Solomon made all the vessels for the house of God, and the gold altar, and the tables upon which were the bread of the presence;
2 Chronicles 4:20	and also, of the purest gold, the lampstands with their lamps, to shine before the oracle, according to the rite;
2 Chronicles 4:21	and certain flowers, and lamps, and gold tongs. All these were made from the purest gold.
2 Chronicles 4:22	Also, the vessels for the perfumes, and the censers, and the bowls, and the little mortars were from the purest gold. And he engraved the doors of the inner temple, that is, for the Holy of Holies. And the doors of the outer temple were of gold. And so, every work was completed that Solomon made in the house of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 5:1	Then Solomon brought in all the things that David his father had vowed, the silver, and the gold, and all the vessels, which he placed in the treasuries of the house of God.
2 Chronicles 5:2	After this, he gathered together those greater by birth of Israel, and all the leaders of the tribes, and the heads of the families, from the sons of Israel, to Jerusalem, so that they might bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord from the City of David, which is Zion.
2 Chronicles 5:3	And so, all the men of Israel went to the king, on the solemn day of the seventh month.
2 Chronicles 5:4	And when all the elders of Israel had arrived, the Levites carried the ark,
2 Chronicles 5:5	and they brought it in, along with all the equipment of the tabernacle. Then too, the priests with the Levites carried the vessels of the sanctuary, which were in the tabernacle.
2 Chronicles 5:6	Now king Solomon, and the entire assembly of Israel, and all who had gathered together before the ark, were immolating rams and oxen without any number, for so great was the multitude of the victims.
2 Chronicles 5:7	And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord to its place, that is, to the oracle of the temple, in the Holy of Holies, under the wings of the cherubim,
2 Chronicles 5:8	so that the cherubim extended their wings over the place where the ark was positioned, and they covered the ark itself and its bars.
2 Chronicles 5:9	But concerning the bars by which the ark was carried, because they were a little longer, the ends were able to be seen before the oracle. Yet truly, if anyone were a little ways toward the exterior, he would not be able to see them. And so the ark has been in that place, even to the present day.
2 Chronicles 5:10	And there was nothing else in the ark, except the two tablets, which Moses had placed there at Horeb when the Lord gave the law to the sons of Israel, at the departure from Egypt.
2 Chronicles 5:11	And having gone out from the Sanctuary, the priests (for all the priests who were able to be found there were sanctified, and in that time the turns and orders of the ministries had not yet been divided among them)
2 Chronicles 5:12	with both the Levites and the singing men, that is, those who were under Asaph, and those who were under Heman, and those who were under Jeduthun, with their sons and brothers, clothed in fine linen, sounded out with cymbals, and psalteries, and harps, standing toward the eastern side of the altar. And with them were one hundred twenty priests, sounding out with trumpets.
2 Chronicles 5:13	And when they all sounded out together, with trumpets, and voice, and cymbals, and pipes, and with various kinds of musical instruments, lifting their voice on high, the sound was heard from far away, so that when they had begun to praise the Lord, and to say, “Confess to the Lord, for he is good; for his mercy is eternal,” the house of God was filled with a cloud.
2 Chronicles 5:14	Neither were the priests able to stand and to minister, because of the cloud. For the glory of the Lord had filled the house of God.
2 Chronicles 6:1	Then Solomon said: “The Lord has promised that he would dwell in a cloud.
2 Chronicles 6:2	But I have built a house to his name, so that he may dwell there forever.”
2 Chronicles 6:3	And the king turned his face, and he blessed the entire multitude of Israel, (for the whole crowd was standing and attentive) and he said:
2 Chronicles 6:4	“Blessed is the Lord, the God of Israel, who has completed the work that he spoke to David my father, saying:
2 Chronicles 6:5	‘From the day when I led my people away from the land of Egypt, I did not choose a city from all the tribes of Israel, so that a house would be built in it to my name. And I did not choose any other man, so that he would be the ruler of my people Israel.
2 Chronicles 6:6	But I chose Jerusalem, so that my name would be in it. And I chose David, so that I might appoint him over my people Israel.’
2 Chronicles 6:7	And though David, my father, had decided that he would build a house to the name of the Lord God of Israel,
2 Chronicles 6:8	the Lord said to him: ‘In so far as it was your will that you build a house to my name, certainly you have done well in having such a will.
2 Chronicles 6:9	But you shall not build the house. Truly, your son, who will go forth from your loins, shall build a house to my name.’
2 Chronicles 6:10	Therefore, the Lord has accomplished his word, which he had spoken. And I have risen up in place of my father David, and I sit upon the throne of Israel, just as the Lord spoke. And I have built a house to the name of the Lord, the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles 6:11	And I have placed in it the ark, in which is the covenant of the Lord that he formed with the sons of Israel.”
2 Chronicles 6:12	Then he stood before the altar of the Lord, facing the entire multitude of Israel, and he extended his hands.
2 Chronicles 6:13	For indeed, Solomon had made a bronze base, and he had positioned it in the midst of the hall; it held five cubits in length, and five cubits in width, and three cubits in height. And he stood upon it. And next, kneeling down while facing the entire multitude of Israel, and lifting up his palms towards heaven,
2 Chronicles 6:14	he said: “O Lord God of Israel, there is no god like you in heaven or on earth. You preserve covenant and mercy with your servants, who walk before you with all their hearts.
2 Chronicles 6:15	You fulfilled for your servant David, my father, whatsoever you had said to him. And you carried out the deed that you promised with your mouth, just as the present time proves.
2 Chronicles 6:16	Now then, O Lord God of Israel, fulfill for your servant David, my father, whatsoever you said to him, saying: ‘There shall not fail to be a man from you before me, who will sit upon the throne of Israel, yet only if your sons will guard their ways, and will walk in my law, just as you also have walked before me.’
2 Chronicles 6:17	And now, O Lord God of Israel, let your word be confirmed that you spoke to your servant David.
2 Chronicles 6:18	How then is it to be believe that God would dwell with men upon the earth? If heaven and the heavens of the heavens do not contain you, how much less this house that I have built?
2 Chronicles 6:19	But it has been done for this only, so that you may look with favor upon the prayer of your servant, and on his supplication, O Lord my God, and so that you may hear the prayers which your servant pours out before you,
2 Chronicles 6:20	and so that you may open your eyes over this house, day and night, over the place where you promised that your name would be invoked,
2 Chronicles 6:21	and so that you may heed the prayer which your servant is praying within it, and so that you may heed the prayers of your servant and of your people Israel. Whoever will pray in this place, listen from your habitation, that is, from heaven, and forgive.
2 Chronicles 6:22	If anyone will have sinned against his neighbor, and he arrives to swear against him, and to bind himself with a curse before the altar in this house,
2 Chronicles 6:23	you will hear him from heaven, and you will execute justice for your servants, so that you return, to the iniquitous man, his own way upon his own head, and so that you vindicate the just man, repaying him according to his own justice.
2 Chronicles 6:24	If your people Israel will have been overwhelmed by their enemies, (for they will sin against you) and having been converted will do penance, and if they will have beseeched your name, and will have prayed in this place,
2 Chronicles 6:25	you will heed them from heaven, and you will forgive the sin of your people Israel, and you will lead them back into the land that you gave to them and to their fathers.
2 Chronicles 6:26	If the heavens have been closed, so that rain does not fall, because of the sin of the people, and if they will petition you in this place, and confess to your name, and be converted from their sins when you will afflict them,
2 Chronicles 6:27	heed them from heaven, O Lord, and forgive the sins of your servants and of your people Israel, and teach them the good way, by which they may advance, and give rain to the land that you gave to your people as a possession.
2 Chronicles 6:28	If a famine will have risen up in the land, or pestilence, or fungus, or mildew, or locusts, or beetles, or if enemies will have laid waste to the countryside and will have besieged the gates of the cities, or whatever scourge or infirmity will have pressed upon them,
2 Chronicles 6:29	if anyone from your people Israel, knowing his own scourge and infirmity, will have made supplication and will have extended his hands in this house,
2 Chronicles 6:30	you will heed him from heaven, indeed from your sublime habitation, and you will forgive, and you will repay each one according to his ways, which you know him to hold in his heart. For you alone know the hearts of the sons of men.
2 Chronicles 6:31	So may they fear you, and so may they walk in your ways, during all the days that they live upon the face of the land, which you gave to our fathers.
2 Chronicles 6:32	Also, if the outsider, who is not from your people Israel, will have arrived from a far away land, because of your great name, and because of your robust hand and your outstretched arm, and if he will adore in this place,
2 Chronicles 6:33	you will heed him from heaven, your most firm habitation, and you will accomplish all the things about which this sojourner will have called out to you, so that all the people of the earth may know your name, and may fear you, just as your people Israel do, and so that they may know that your name is invoked over this house, which I have built.
2 Chronicles 6:34	If, having gone out to war against their adversaries along the way that you will send them, your people adore you facing in the direction of this city, which you have chosen, and of this house, which I have built to your name,
2 Chronicles 6:35	you will heed their prayers from heaven, and their supplications, and you will vindicate them.
2 Chronicles 6:36	But if they will have sinned against you (for there is no man who does not sin) and you will have become angry against them, and if you will have delivered them to their enemies, and so they lead them away as captives to a far away land, or even to one that is near,
2 Chronicles 6:37	and if, having been converted in their heart in the land to which they had been led as captives, they will do penance, and beseech you in the land of their captivity, saying, ‘We have sinned; we have committed iniquity; we have acted unjustly,’
2 Chronicles 6:38	and if they will have returned to you, with their whole heart and with their whole soul, in the land of their captivity to which they were led away, and if they will adore you in the direction of their own land, which you gave to their fathers, and of the city, which you have chosen, and of the house, which I have built to your name,
2 Chronicles 6:39	from heaven, that is, from your firm habitation, you will heed their prayers, and you will accomplish judgment, and you will forgive your people, even though they are sinners.
2 Chronicles 6:40	For you are my God. Let your eyes be open, I beg you, and let your ears be attentive to the prayer that is made in this place.
2 Chronicles 6:41	Now therefore, rise up, O Lord God, to your resting place, you and the ark of your strength. Let your priests, O Lord God, be clothed with salvation, and let your holy ones rejoice in what is good.
2 Chronicles 6:42	O Lord God, may you not turn away from the face of your Christ. Remember the mercies of your servant, David.”
2 Chronicles 7:1	And when Solomon had completed pouring out his prayers, fire descended from heaven, and it devoured the holocausts and the victims. And the majesty of the Lord filled the house.
2 Chronicles 7:2	Neither were the priests able to enter into the temple of the Lord, because the majesty of the Lord had filled the temple of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 7:3	Moreover, all the sons of Israel saw the fire descending, and the glory of the Lord upon the house. And falling prone upon the ground, on the layer of pavement stones, they adored and praised the Lord: “For he is good. For his mercy is everlasting.”
2 Chronicles 7:4	Then the king and all the people were immolating victims before the Lord.
2 Chronicles 7:5	And so, king Solomon slaughtered victims: twenty-two thousand oxen, and one hundred twenty thousand rams. And the king and the entire people dedicated the house of God.
2 Chronicles 7:6	Then the priests and the Levites were standing in their offices, with the instruments of music for the Lord, which king David made in order to praise the Lord: “For his mercy is eternal.” And they were playing the hymns of David with their hands. And the priests were sounding out with trumpets before them, and all of Israel was standing.
2 Chronicles 7:7	Also, Solomon sanctified the middle of the atrium in front of the temple of the Lord. For he had offered the holocausts and the fat of peace offerings in that place because the bronze altar, which he had made, had not been able to support the holocausts and the sacrifices and the fat.
2 Chronicles 7:8	Therefore, Solomon kept the solemnity, at that time, for seven days, and all of Israel with him, a very great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath, even to the torrent of Egypt.
2 Chronicles 7:9	And on the eighth day, he held a solemn gathering, because he had dedicated the altar over seven days, and he had celebrated the solemnity over seven days.
2 Chronicles 7:10	And so, on the twenty-third day of the seventh month, he dismissed the people to their dwellings, joyful and glad over the good that the Lord had done for David, and for Solomon, and for his people Israel.
2 Chronicles 7:11	And Solomon completed the house of the Lord, and the house of the king, and all that he had resolved in his heart to do for the house of the Lord, and for his own house. And he prospered.
2 Chronicles 7:12	Then the Lord appeared to him by night, and said: “I have heard your prayer, and I have chosen this place for myself as a house of sacrifice.
2 Chronicles 7:13	If I close up heaven, so that no rain will fall, or if I order and instruct the locust to devour the land, or if I send a pestilence among my people,
2 Chronicles 7:14	and if my people, over whom my name has been invoked, being converted, will have petitioned me and sought my face, and will have done penance for their wicked ways, then I will heed them from heaven, and I will forgive their sins, and I will heal their land.
2 Chronicles 7:15	Also, my eyes will be open, and my ears will be attentive, to the prayer of him who shall pray in this place.
2 Chronicles 7:16	For I have chosen and sanctified this place, so that my name may be there continually, and so that my eyes and my heart may remain there, for all days.
2 Chronicles 7:17	And as for you, if you will walk before me, just as your father David walked, and if you will act in accord with all that I have instructed you, and if you will observe my justices and judgments,
2 Chronicles 7:18	I will raise up the throne of your kingdom, just as I promised to your father David, saying: ‘There shall not be taken away a man from your stock who will be ruler in Israel.’
2 Chronicles 7:19	But if you will have turned away, and will have forsaken my justices and my precepts, which I have set before you, and going astray, you serve strange gods, and you adore them,
2 Chronicles 7:20	I will uproot you from my land, which I gave to you, and from this house, which I sanctified to my name, and I will cast it away from before my face, and I will deliver it to be a parable and an example for all the peoples.
2 Chronicles 7:21	And this house will be like a proverb to all who pass by. And being astonished, they shall say: ‘Why has the Lord acted this way toward this land and toward this house?’
2 Chronicles 7:22	And they shall respond: ‘Because they abandoned the Lord, the God of their fathers, who led them away from the land of Egypt, and they took hold of foreign gods, and they adored and worshipped them. Therefore, all these evils have overwhelmed them.’ ”
2 Chronicles 8:1	Then, twenty years having passed since Solomon built the house of the Lord and his own house,
2 Chronicles 8:2	he built the cities that Hiram had given to Solomon, and he caused the sons of Israel to live there.
2 Chronicles 8:3	Also, he went to Hamath Zobah, and he obtained it.
2 Chronicles 8:4	And he built Palmira in the desert, and he built very fortified cities in Hamath.
2 Chronicles 8:5	And he built upper Beth-horon and lower Beth-horon, as walled cities, having gates and bars and locks,
2 Chronicles 8:6	as well as Baalath, and all the very strong cities which were of Solomon, and all the cities of the chariots, and the cities of the horsemen. Everything whatsoever that Solomon willed and decided, he built in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and throughout the entire land of his authority.
2 Chronicles 8:7	All the people who had been left from the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, those who were not from the stock of Israel,
2 Chronicles 8:8	those of their sons and their posterity whom the sons of Israel had not put to death, Solomon subjugated as tributaries, even to this day.
2 Chronicles 8:9	But he did not appoint anyone from the sons of Israel to serve in the works of the king. For they were men of war, and first rulers, and commanders of his chariots and horsemen.
2 Chronicles 8:10	Now all the leaders of the army of king Solomon were two hundred fifty, who were instructing the people.
2 Chronicles 8:11	Truly, he transferred the daughter of Pharaoh, from the City of David, to the house that he had built for her. For the king said: “My wife shall not live in the house of David, king of Israel, for it has been sanctified. For the ark of the Lord has entered into it.”
2 Chronicles 8:12	Then Solomon offered holocausts to the Lord on the altar of the Lord, which he had constructed before the portico,
2 Chronicles 8:13	so that every day there would be an offering on it, in accord with precept of Moses, on the Sabbaths, and on the new moons, and three times a year on the feast days, that is, on the solemnity of unleavened bread, and on the solemnity of weeks, and in the solemnity of tabernacles.
2 Chronicles 8:14	And he appointed, in accord with the plan of his father David, the offices of the priests in their ministries; and those of the Levites, in their orders, so that they might praise and minister before the priests according to the ritual of each day; and the porters, in their divisions, from gate to gate. For so had David, the man of God, instructed.
2 Chronicles 8:15	Neither the priests, nor the Levites, transgressed against the commands of the king, in all that he had instructed, and in the keeping of the treasuries.
2 Chronicles 8:16	Solomon had all the expenses prepared, from the day on which he founded the house of the Lord, even until the day when he perfected it.
2 Chronicles 8:17	Then Solomon went away to Eziongeber, and to Eloth, on the coast of the Red Sea, which is in the land of Edom.
2 Chronicles 8:18	And Hiram sent to him ships, by the hands of his servants, sailors and skillful navigators of the sea, and they went away with the servants of Solomon to Ophir. And they took from there four hundred fifty talents of gold, and they brought it to king Solomon.
2 Chronicles 9:1	Also, when the queen of Sheba had heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to Jerusalem, with great riches and with camels which were carrying aromatics, and very much gold, and precious gems, so that she might test him with enigmas. And when she had approached Solomon, she spoke to him all that was in her heart.
2 Chronicles 9:2	And Solomon explained for her all that she had proposed. And there was nothing that he did not make clear to her.
2 Chronicles 9:3	And after she saw these things, specifically, the wisdom of Solomon, and the house which he had built,
2 Chronicles 9:4	indeed also the foods of his table, and the habitations of the servants, and the duties of his ministers, and their apparel, and also his cupbearers and their garments, and the victims which he was immolating in the house of the Lord, there was no longer any spirit in her, due to astonishment.
2 Chronicles 9:5	And she said to the king: “The word is true, which I had heard in my own land, about your virtues and wisdom.
2 Chronicles 9:6	I did not believe those who described it, until I had arrived and my eyes had seen, and I had proven that not even half of your wisdom had been described to me. You have exceeded your fame with your virtue.
2 Chronicles 9:7	Blessed are your men, and blessed are your servants, who stand before you at all times and listen to your wisdom.
2 Chronicles 9:8	Blessed is the Lord your God, who willed to set you upon his throne as a king for the Lord your God. Since God loves Israel, he wishes to preserve them unto eternity. For this reason, he appointed you as king over them, so that you may accomplish judgment and justice.”
2 Chronicles 9:9	Then she gave to the king one hundred twenty talents of gold, and an exceedingly great abundance of aromatics, and very precious gems. Never were there such aromatics as those that the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.
2 Chronicles 9:10	Then too, the servants of Hiram, with the servants of Solomon, brought gold from Ophir, and wood from thyine trees, and very precious gems.
2 Chronicles 9:11	And the king made, from this particular thyine wood, steps in the house of the Lord, and in the house of the king, and also harps and psalteries for the singing men. Never was there seen such wood in the land of Judah.
2 Chronicles 9:12	Then king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all that she desired, and all that she requested, and much more than what she had brought to him. And returning, she went away to her own land with her servants.
2 Chronicles 9:13	Now the weight of the gold, which was being brought to Solomon throughout each year, was six hundred sixty-six talents of gold,
2 Chronicles 9:14	apart from the sum that the legates of various nations and the merchants were accustomed to bring, and apart from the gold and silver that all the kings of Arabia, and the princes of the lands, were bringing together for Solomon.
2 Chronicles 9:15	And so, king Solomon made two hundred gold spears, from six hundred gold pieces, the amount used for each spear,
2 Chronicles 9:16	and also three hundred gold shields, from three hundred gold pieces, which covered each shield. And the king placed them in the armory, which was situated in a forest.
2 Chronicles 9:17	Also, the king made a great ivory throne, and he clothed it with the purest gold.
2 Chronicles 9:18	And there were six steps, by which he would ascend to the throne, and a footstool of gold, and two arms, one on each side, and two lions standing beside the arms.
2 Chronicles 9:19	Moreover, there were twelve additional little lions standing upon the six steps on both sides. There was no similar throne in all the kingdoms.
2 Chronicles 9:20	Also, all the vessels for the feasts of the king were of gold, and the vessels of the forest house of Lebanon were from the purest gold. For silver in those days was considered as nothing.
2 Chronicles 9:21	For indeed, the ships of the king went to Tarshish, with the servants of Hiram, once every three years. And they brought from there gold, and silver, and ivory, and primates, and peacocks.
2 Chronicles 9:22	And so, Solomon was magnified above all the kings of the earth in wealth and glory.
2 Chronicles 9:23	And all the kings of the lands were desiring to see the face of Solomon, so that they might hear the wisdom that God had granted to his heart.
2 Chronicles 9:24	And they were bringing to him gifts, vessels of silver and of gold, and garments, and armor, and aromatics, and horses, and mules, throughout each year.
2 Chronicles 9:25	Also, Solomon had forty thousand horses in the stables, and twelve thousand chariots and horsemen, and he appointed them to the cities of the chariots, and where the king was in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 9:26	Now he also exercised authority over all the kings from the river Euphrates as far as the land of the Philistines, and as far as the borders of Egypt.
2 Chronicles 9:27	And he brought forth so much silver that it was as plentiful in Jerusalem as stones. And cedar trees were as great in number as the sycamores that spring up in the plains.
2 Chronicles 9:28	And horses were brought to him from Egypt and from every region.
2 Chronicles 9:29	Now the rest of the works of Solomon, the first and the last, have been written in the words of Nathan, the prophet, and in the books of Ahijah, the Shilonite, as well as in the vision of Iddo, the seer, against Jeroboam, the son of Nabat.
2 Chronicles 9:30	And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem, over all of Israel, for forty years.
2 Chronicles 9:31	And he slept with his fathers. And they buried him in the City of David. And his son, Rehoboam, reigned in his place.
2 Chronicles 10:1	Now Rehoboam set out for Shechem. For in that place all of Israel had convened, so that they might appoint him as king.
2 Chronicles 10:2	But when Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, who was in Egypt, (indeed he had fled to that place from Solomon) had heard it, he promptly returned.
2 Chronicles 10:3	And they summoned him, and he arrived with all of Israel. And they spoke to Rehoboam, saying:
2 Chronicles 10:4	“Your father pressed upon us a very difficult yoke. You should govern us more lightly than your father, who imposed on us a heavy servitude, and so lift up some of the burden, so that we may serve you.”
2 Chronicles 10:5	But he said, “Return to me after three days.” And when the people had gone away,
2 Chronicles 10:6	he took counsel with the elders, who had stood before his father Solomon while he was still living, saying, “What counsel would you give to me, so that I may respond to the people?”
2 Chronicles 10:7	And they said to him, “If you please this people, and if you soothe them with words of clemency, they will be your servants for all days.”
2 Chronicles 10:8	But he set aside the counsel of the elders, and he began to have discussion with the youth, who had been raised with him and who were among his companions.
2 Chronicles 10:9	And he said to them: “How does it seem to you? Or how should I respond to this people, who have said to me, ‘Lift up the yoke that your father imposed upon us?’ ”
2 Chronicles 10:10	But they responded like youths, having been raised with him in luxury, and they said: “So shall you speak to the people, who said to you, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy; you should lighten it,’ and so shall you respond to them: ‘My little finger is thicker than the back of my father.
2 Chronicles 10:11	My father imposed a heavy yoke upon you, and I will place more weight upon it. My father cut you with whips; truly, I will beat you with scorpions.’ ”
2 Chronicles 10:12	Then Jeroboam, and the entire people, went to Rehoboam on the third day, just as he had instructed them.
2 Chronicles 10:13	And the king responded harshly, abandoning the counsel of the elders.
2 Chronicles 10:14	And he spoke according to the will of the youths: “My father imposed a heavy yoke upon you, which I will make heavier. My father cut you with whips; truly, I will beat you with scorpions.”
2 Chronicles 10:15	And he did not acquiesce to the pleadings of the people. For it was the will of God that his word be fulfilled, which he had spoken by the hand of Ahijah, the Shilonite, to Jeroboam, the son of Nabat.
2 Chronicles 10:16	Then the entire people, speaking more harshly to the king, spoke to him in this way: “There is no portion for us in David, and there is no inheritance in the son of Jesse. Return to your dwellings, O Israel. Then you, O David, shall pasture your own house.” And Israel went away to their dwellings.
2 Chronicles 10:17	But Rehoboam reigned over the sons of Israel who were living in the cities of Judah.
2 Chronicles 10:18	And king Rehoboam sent Aduram, who was in charge of the tributes. And the sons of Israel stoned him, and he died. And so king Rehoboam hurried to climb into the chariot, and he fled to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 10:19	And Israel withdrew from the house of David, even to this day.
2 Chronicles 11:1	Then Rehoboam went to Jerusalem, and he called together the entire house of Judah and of Benjamin, one hundred eighty thousand elect men of war, so that he might contend against Israel, and turn back his kingdom to himself.
2 Chronicles 11:2	And the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah, the man of God, saying:
2 Chronicles 11:3	“Speak to Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, the king of Judah, and to all of Israel who are of Judah, or of Benjamin:
2 Chronicles 11:4	Thus says the Lord: You shall not ascend and fight against your brothers. Let each one return to his own house. For it is by my will that this has happened.” And when they had heard the word of the Lord, they turned back, and they did not continue on against Jeroboam.
2 Chronicles 11:5	Then Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem, and he built fortified cities in Judah.
2 Chronicles 11:6	And he built up Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,
2 Chronicles 11:7	and also Bethzur, and Soco, and Adullam,
2 Chronicles 11:8	indeed also Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,
2 Chronicles 11:9	then too Adoram, and Lachish, and Azekah,
2 Chronicles 11:10	as well as Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which were very fortified cities in Judah and in Benjamin.
2 Chronicles 11:11	And when he had enclosed them with walls, he placed in them rulers, and storehouses of provisions, that is, of oil and wine.
2 Chronicles 11:12	Moreover, in each city he made an armory of shields and spears, and he strengthened them with the utmost diligence. And he ruled over Judah and Benjamin.
2 Chronicles 11:13	Then the priests and Levites, who were in all of Israel, came to him from all their settlements,
2 Chronicles 11:14	leaving behind their suburbs and possessions, and crossing over to Judah and to Jerusalem. For Jeroboam and his followers had cast them out, so that they could not exercise the priestly office to the Lord.
2 Chronicles 11:15	And he appointed for himself priests of high places, and of demons, and of calves that he had made.
2 Chronicles 11:16	Moreover, out of all the tribes of Israel, whosoever would give their heart so that they sought the Lord God of Israel, they went to Jerusalem to immolate their victims before the Lord, the God of their fathers.
2 Chronicles 11:17	And they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and they confirmed Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, for three years. For they walked in the ways of David and of Solomon, but only for three years.
2 Chronicles 11:18	Then Rehoboam took as wife Mahalath, the daughter of Jerimoth, son of David, and also Abihail, the daughter of Eliab, son of Jesse.
2 Chronicles 11:19	They bore sons for him: Jeush, and Shemariah, and Zaham.
2 Chronicles 11:20	And also after her, he married Maacah, the daughter of Absalom, who bore for him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.
2 Chronicles 11:21	But Rehoboam loved Maacah, the daughter of Absalom, above all his wives and concubines. For he had taken eighteen wives and sixty concubines. And he conceived twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.
2 Chronicles 11:22	Truly, he appointed as the head, Abijah, the son of Maacah, to be the ruler over all his brothers. For he thought to make him king,
2 Chronicles 11:23	since he was wiser and more powerful than all his sons, even in all the regions of Judah and Benjamin, and in all the fortified cities. And he provided them with very much food, and he sought many wives.
2 Chronicles 12:1	And when the kingdom of Rehoboam had been strengthened and fortified, he abandoned the law of the Lord, and all of Israel with him.
2 Chronicles 12:2	Then, in the fifth year of the reign of Rehoboam, Shishak, the king of Egypt, ascended against Jerusalem (for they had sinned against the Lord)
2 Chronicles 12:3	with one thousand two hundred chariots and sixty thousand horsemen. And the common people could not be numbered who had arrived with him from Egypt, namely, the Libyans, and the Troglodytes, and the Ethiopians.
2 Chronicles 12:4	And he seized the most fortified cities in Judah, and he went even to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 12:5	Then Shemaiah, the prophet, entered to Rehoboam, and to the leaders of Judah who had gathered together in Jerusalem while fleeing from Shishak, and he said to them: “Thus says the Lord: You have abandoned me, and so I have abandoned you into the hand of Shishak.”
2 Chronicles 12:6	And the leaders of Israel, and the king, being in consternation, said, “The Lord is just.”
2 Chronicles 12:7	And when the Lord had seen that they were humbled, the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah, saying: “Because they have been humbled, I will not disperse them. And I will give to them a little help, and my fury will not rain down upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.
2 Chronicles 12:8	Yet truly, they shall serve him, so that they may know the difference between my servitude, and the servitude of a kingdom of the lands.”
2 Chronicles 12:9	And so Shishak, the king of Egypt, withdrew from Jerusalem, taking up the treasures of the house of the Lord and of the house of the king. And he took away everything with him, even the gold shields that Solomon had made.
2 Chronicles 12:10	In place of these, the king made bronze ones, and he delivered them to the leaders of the shield bearers, who were guarding the vestibule of the palace.
2 Chronicles 12:11	And when the king would enter into the house of the Lord, the shield bearers would arrive and take them, and they would carry them back to their armory.
2 Chronicles 12:12	Yet truly, because they were humbled, the wrath of the Lord turned away from them, and so they were not utterly destroyed. And indeed, good works were also found in Judah.
2 Chronicles 12:13	Therefore, king Rehoboam was strengthened in Jerusalem, and he reigned. He was forty-one years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city that the Lord chose out of all the tribes of Israel, so that he might confirm his name there. Now the name of his mother was Naamah, an Ammonite.
2 Chronicles 12:14	But he did evil, and he did not prepare his heart so as to seek the Lord.
2 Chronicles 12:15	Truly, the works of Rehoboam, the first and the last, have been written in the books of Shemaiah, the prophet, and of Iddo, the seer, and diligently set forth. And Rehoboam and Jeroboam fought against one another during all their days.
2 Chronicles 12:16	And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the City of David. And his son, Abijah, reigned in his place.
2 Chronicles 13:1	In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam, Abijah reigned over Judah.
2 Chronicles 13:2	He reigned for three years in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother was Micaiah, the daughter of Uriel, from Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
2 Chronicles 13:3	And when Abijah had undertaken the conflict, and he had with him four hundred thousand elect men, very fit for war, Jeroboam set up a battle line opposite him of eight hundred thousand men, who were also elect and very strong in warfare.
2 Chronicles 13:4	Then Abijah stood upon mount Zemaraim, which was in Ephraim, and he said: “Listen to me, Jeroboam and all of Israel.
2 Chronicles 13:5	Are you ignorant that the Lord, the God of Israel, gave David the kingship over Israel for all time, to him and to his sons, by a covenant of salt?
2 Chronicles 13:6	But Jeroboam, the son of Nabat, the servant of Solomon, son of David, rose up and rebelled against his lord.
2 Chronicles 13:7	And there were gathered to him very vain men, and sons of Belial. And they prevailed against Rehoboam, the son of Solomon. For Rehoboam was inexperienced, and he had a fearful heart, and so he was unable to resist them.
2 Chronicles 13:8	Now therefore, you say that you are able to resist the kingdom of the Lord, which he possesses through the sons of David, and you have a great multitude of people, and gold calves, which Jeroboam made for you as gods.
2 Chronicles 13:9	And you have cast out the priests of the Lord, the sons of Aaron, as well as the Levites. And like all the peoples of the lands, you have made priests for yourselves. Anyone who is willing to come and perform the ritual by his hand, with a bull from the herd and with seven rams, is made a priest of those who are not gods.
2 Chronicles 13:10	But the Lord is our God, and we have not forsaken him. And the priests who minister to the Lord are from the sons of Aaron. And the Levites are in their proper order.
2 Chronicles 13:11	Also, they offer holocausts to the Lord, each and every day, morning and evening, and incense composed according to the precept of the law, and the bread of the presence on a very pure table. And there is with us the gold lampstand with its lamps, so that they may burn continually in the evening. For certainly, we keep the precepts of the Lord our God, whom you have forsaken.
2 Chronicles 13:12	Therefore, God is the commander of our army, with his priests, who sound the trumpets that ring out against you. O sons of Israel, do not choose to fight against the Lord, the God of your fathers. For it is not expedient for you.”
2 Chronicles 13:13	While he was speaking these things, Jeroboam set in motion an ambush behind them. And while they stood facing the enemy, without Judah realizing it, his army circled around.
2 Chronicles 13:14	And looking back, Judah saw the war threatening in front and behind, and they cried out to the Lord. And the priests began to sound the trumpets.
2 Chronicles 13:15	And all the men of Judah shouted out. And behold, when they cried out, God terrified Jeroboam, and all of Israel who were standing in opposition to Abijah and Judah.
2 Chronicles 13:16	And the sons of Israel fled from Judah, and the Lord delivered them into their hand.
2 Chronicles 13:17	Therefore, Abijah and his people struck them with a great slaughter. And five hundred thousand strong men of Israel fell wounded.
2 Chronicles 13:18	And the sons of Israel were humiliated at that time. And the sons of Judah were very greatly strengthened, because they had trusted in the Lord, the God of their fathers.
2 Chronicles 13:19	Then Abijah pursued the fleeing Jeroboam. And he seized cities from him: Bethel and her daughters, and Jeshanah with her daughters, and also Ephron and her daughters.
2 Chronicles 13:20	And Jeroboam no longer had the strength to resist, in the days of Abijah. And the Lord struck him, and he died.
2 Chronicles 13:21	And so Abijah, having been strengthened in his authority, took fourteen wives. And he procreated twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.
2 Chronicles 13:22	Now the rest of the words of Abijah, and his ways and works, have been written very diligently in the book of Iddo, the prophet.
2 Chronicles 14:1	Then Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the City of David. And his son, Asa, reigned in his place. During his days, the land was quiet for ten years.
2 Chronicles 14:2	Now Asa did what was good and pleasing in the sight of his God. And he overturned the altars of foreign worship, and the high places.
2 Chronicles 14:3	And he broke apart the statues, and he cut down the sacred groves.
2 Chronicles 14:4	And he instructed Judah that they should seek the Lord, the God of their fathers, and that they should carry out the law and all the commandments.
2 Chronicles 14:5	And he took away, from all the cities of Judah, the altars and the shrines. And he reigned in peace.
2 Chronicles 14:6	Also, he built fortified cities in Judah. For it was quiet, and in his time no wars had arisen. For the Lord was generously granting peace.
2 Chronicles 14:7	Then he said to Judah: “Let us build these cities, and strengthen them with walls, and fortify them with towers and gates and bars, while all things are at rest from wars. For we have sought the Lord, the God of our fathers, and he has granted to us peace on every side.” And so they built, and there was nothing to impede them from building.
2 Chronicles 14:8	Now Asa had in his army three hundred thousand men of Judah, carrying shields and spears, and truly, of Benjamin, two hundred eighty thousand men with shields and bows. All of these were very valiant men.
2 Chronicles 14:9	Then Zerah, the Ethiopian, went forth against them with his army of one million men, and three hundred chariots. And he approached as far as Mareshah.
2 Chronicles 14:10	And Asa traveled to meet him, and he set up a battle line for the war in the Valley of Zephathah, which is near Mareshah.
2 Chronicles 14:11	And he called upon the Lord God, and he said: “O Lord, there is no difference to you, whether you assist by few, or by many. Help us, O Lord our God. For having faith in you and in your name, we have gone forth against this multitude. O Lord, you are our God. Do not allow man to prevail against you.”
2 Chronicles 14:12	And so the Lord terrified the Ethiopians before Asa and Judah. And the Ethiopians fled.
2 Chronicles 14:13	And Asa, and the people who were with him, pursued them as far as Gerar. And the Ethiopians fell, even unto utter destruction, for the Lord was striking, and his army was battling, and they were destroyed. Therefore, they took many spoils.
2 Chronicles 14:14	And they struck all the cities surrounding Gerar. For indeed, a great fear had overwhelmed everyone. And they despoiled the cities, and they carried away much plunder.
2 Chronicles 14:15	Then too, destroying the fencing for the sheep, they took an innumerable multitude of cattle and camels. And they returned to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 15:1	Now Azariah, the son of Oded, had the Spirit of God within him.
2 Chronicles 15:2	And he went out to meet Asa, and he said to him: “Listen to me, Asa and all of Judah and Benjamin. The Lord is with you, because you have been with him. If you seek him, you will find him. But if you abandon him, he will abandon you.
2 Chronicles 15:3	Then many days will pass in Israel, apart from the true God, and apart from a learned priest, and apart from the law.
2 Chronicles 15:4	And when, in their anguish, they will have returned to the Lord, the God of Israel, and will have sought him, they shall find him.
2 Chronicles 15:5	In that time, there will be no peace for those who depart and those who enter. Instead, there will be terror on every side, among all the inhabitants of the lands.
2 Chronicles 15:6	For nation will fight against nation, and city against city. For the Lord will disturb them with every anguish.
2 Chronicles 15:7	But as for you, be strengthened, and do not let your hands be weakened. For there will be a reward for your work.”
2 Chronicles 15:8	And when Asa had heard these particular words, and the prophecy of the prophet Azariah, the son of Oded, he was strengthened, and he took away the idols from the entire land of Judah, and from Benjamin, and from the cities that he had seized of mount Ephraim, and he dedicated the altar of the Lord, which was before the portico of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 15:9	And he gathered together all of Judah and Benjamin, and with them the new arrivals from Ephraim and Manasseh and Simeon. For many had fled to him from Israel, seeing that the Lord his God was with him.
2 Chronicles 15:10	And when they had arrived in Jerusalem, in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa,
2 Chronicles 15:11	they immolated to the Lord on that day, from the best of the spoils and from the plunder that they had brought: seven hundred oxen and seven thousand rams.
2 Chronicles 15:12	And he entered, according to custom, in order to confirm the covenant, so that they would seek the Lord, the God of their fathers, with their whole heart and with their whole soul.
2 Chronicles 15:13	“But if anyone,” he said, “will not seek the Lord, the God of Israel, let him die, from the least even to the greatest, from man even to woman.”
2 Chronicles 15:14	And they swore to the Lord, with a great voice, in jubilation, and with the blare of trumpets, and with the sound of horns,
2 Chronicles 15:15	all who were in Judah swore with a curse. For with all their heart they swore, and with all their will they sought and found him. And the Lord granted rest on all sides to them.
2 Chronicles 15:16	Then too, Maacah, the mother of king Asa, he deposed from the august authority, because she had made an idol of Priapus within a sacred grove. And he entirely crushed it, breaking it into pieces, and he burned it at the torrent Kidron.
2 Chronicles 15:17	But some high places were left in Israel. Even so, the heart of Asa was perfect during all his days.
2 Chronicles 15:18	And whatever his father or he himself had vowed, he brought into the house of the Lord: silver and gold, and vessels for various uses.
2 Chronicles 15:19	Truly, there was no war, until the thirty-fifth year of the kingdom of Asa.
2 Chronicles 16:1	Then, in the thirty-sixth year of his reign, Baasha, the king of Israel, ascended against Judah. And he encircled Ramah with a wall, so that no one could safely depart or enter from the kingdom of Asa.
2 Chronicles 16:2	Therefore, Asa brought forth silver and gold from the treasuries of the house of the Lord, and from the treasuries of the king. And he sent to Benhadad, the king of Syria, who was living in Damascus, saying:
2 Chronicles 16:3	“There is a pact between me and you. Also, my father and your father had an agreement. For this reason, I have sent silver and gold to you, so that you may break the pact that you have with Baasha, the king of Israel, and so that you may cause him to withdraw from me.”
2 Chronicles 16:4	And when he verified this, Benhadad sent the leaders of his armies to the cities of Israel. And they struck Ahion, and Dan, and Abelmaim, and all the walled cities of Naphtali.
2 Chronicles 16:5	And when Baasha had heard of it, he ceased to build around Ramah, and he interrupted his work.
2 Chronicles 16:6	Then king Asa took all of Judah, and they carried away from Ramah the stones and the wood that Baasha had prepared for the things to be built. And he built up Gibeah and Mizpah with them.
2 Chronicles 16:7	In that time, the prophet Hanani went to Asa, the king of Judah, and he said to him: “Because you have faith in the king of Syria, and not in the Lord your God, therefore the army of the king of Syria has escaped from your hand.
2 Chronicles 16:8	Were not the Ethiopians and the Libyans much more numerous in chariots, and horsemen, and an exceedingly great multitude? Yet when you believed in the Lord, he delivered them into your hand.
2 Chronicles 16:9	For the eyes of the Lord contemplate the entire earth, and offer fortitude to those who believe in him with a perfect heart. And so, you acted foolishly. And so, because of this, from the present time wars shall rise up against you.”
2 Chronicles 16:10	And Asa was angry against the seer, and he ordered him to be sent into prison. For indeed, he had been very indignant over this. And in that time, he put to death very many of the people.
2 Chronicles 16:11	But the works of Asa, the first and the last, have been written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
2 Chronicles 16:12	And now Asa became ill, in the thirty-ninth year of his reign, with a very severe pain in his feet. And yet, in his infirmity, he did not seek the Lord. Instead, he trusted more in the skill of physicians.
2 Chronicles 16:13	And he slept with his fathers. And he died in the forty-first year of his reign.
2 Chronicles 16:14	And they buried him in his own sepulcher, which he had made for himself in the City of David. And they placed him upon his bed, full of the aromatics and ointments of courtesans, which were composed with the skill of the perfumers. And they burned these over him with very great ostentation.
2 Chronicles 17:1	Then Jehoshaphat, his son, reigned in his place. And he grew strong against Israel.
2 Chronicles 17:2	And he appointed numbers of soldiers in all the cities of Judah that had been fortified with walls. And he placed garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim that his father Asa had seized.
2 Chronicles 17:3	And the Lord was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father, David. And he did not trust in the Baals,
2 Chronicles 17:4	but in the God of his father. And he advanced in his precepts, and not according to the sins of Israel.
2 Chronicles 17:5	And the Lord confirmed the kingdom in his hand. And all of Judah gave gifts to Jehoshaphat. And innumerable riches were brought to him, and much glory.
2 Chronicles 17:6	And when his heart had taken courage because of the ways of the Lord, he now also took away the high places and the sacred groves from Judah.
2 Chronicles 17:7	Then, in the third year of his reign, he sent Benhail, and Obadiah, and Zechariah, and Nethanel, and Micaiah, from among his leaders, so that they might teach in the cites of Judah.
2 Chronicles 17:8	And with them were the Levites Shemaiah and Nethaniah and Zebadiah, and also Asahel and Shemiramoth and Jehonathan, and the Levites Adonijah and Tobijah and Tobadonijah. And with them were the priests Elishama and Jehoram.
2 Chronicles 17:9	And they were teaching the people in Judah, having with them the book of the law of the Lord. And they were traveling through all the cities of Judah, and were instructing the people.
2 Chronicles 17:10	And so, the fear of the Lord fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands which were around Judah. And they did not dare to make war against Jehoshaphat.
2 Chronicles 17:11	Moreover, the Philistines carried gifts to Jehoshaphat, and a tribute in silver. Also, the Arabians brought cattle: seven thousand seven hundred rams, and the same number of he-goats.
2 Chronicles 17:12	Therefore, Jehoshaphat increased and was magnified, even on high. And in Judah, he built houses in the likeness of towers, and walled cities.
2 Chronicles 17:13	And he prepared many works in the cities of Judah. Also, there were men experienced in warfare in Jerusalem,
2 Chronicles 17:14	and this is the number of them, by each of the houses and families. In Judah, the leader of the army was Adnah, the commander; and with him were three hundred thousand very experienced men.
2 Chronicles 17:15	After him, Jehohanan was the leader; and with him were two hundred eighty thousand.
2 Chronicles 17:16	Also after him, there was Amasiah, the son of Zichri, who was consecrated to the Lord; and with him were two hundred thousand strong men.
2 Chronicles 17:17	Following him, there was Eliada, who was experienced in battle; and with him were two hundred thousand, holding bow and shield.
2 Chronicles 17:18	Then too, after him, there was Jehozabad; and with him were one hundred eighty thousand lightly-armed solders.
2 Chronicles 17:19	All these were at the hand of the king, aside from the others, whom he had positioned in the walled cities, in all of Judah.
2 Chronicles 18:1	Therefore, Jehoshaphat was wealthy and very famous, and he was joined by affinity to Ahab.
2 Chronicles 18:2	And after some years, he descended to him in Samaria. And upon his arrival, Ahab slaughtered very many sheep and oxen, for him and for the people who had arrived with him. And he persuaded him that he should ascend against Ramoth Gilead.
2 Chronicles 18:3	And Ahab, the king of Israel, said to Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, “Come with me to Ramoth Gilead.” And he answered him: “As I am, so also are you. As your people are, so also are my people. And we will be with you in war.”
2 Chronicles 18:4	And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “Consult, I beg you, the word of the Lord for the present circumstances.”
2 Chronicles 18:5	And so the king of Israel gathered together four hundred men of the prophets, and he said to them: “Should we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or should we be quieted?” But they said, “Ascend, and God will deliver into the hand of the king.”
2 Chronicles 18:6	And Jehoshaphat said, “Is there not a prophet of the Lord here, so that we may inquire of him as well?”
2 Chronicles 18:7	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat: “There is one man, from whom we would be able to ask the will of the Lord. But I hate him, for he never prophesies good to me, but at all times evil. And it is Micaiah, the son of Imlah.” And Jehoshaphat said, “You should not speak in this manner, O king.”
2 Chronicles 18:8	Therefore, the king of Israel called one of the eunuchs, and said to him: “Quickly, summon Micaiah, the son of Imlah.”
2 Chronicles 18:9	Now the king of Israel, and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, were both sitting upon their thrones, clothed in royal vestments. And they were sitting in an open area, beside the gate of Samaria. And all the prophets were prophesying before them.
2 Chronicles 18:10	Truly, Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, made for himself horns of iron, and he said: “Thus says the Lord: With these, you shall threaten Syria, until you crush it.”
2 Chronicles 18:11	And all the prophets prophesied similarly, and they said: “Ascend against Ramoth Gilead, and you shall prosper, and the Lord will deliver them into the hand of the king.”
2 Chronicles 18:12	Then the messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah said to him: “Lo, the words of all the prophets, with one mouth, announce good to the king. Therefore, I ask you that you not dissent from them in your word, and that you speak prosperity.”
2 Chronicles 18:13	And Micaiah responded to him, “As the Lord lives, whatever my God will say to me, the same shall I speak.”
2 Chronicles 18:14	Therefore, he went to the king. And the king said to him, “Micaiah, should we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or should we be quieted?” And he responded to him: “Ascend. For everything will come to prosperity, and the enemies will be delivered into your hands.”
2 Chronicles 18:15	And the king said, “Again and again, I bind you by an oath, so that you will not speak to me except what is true in the name of the Lord!”
2 Chronicles 18:16	Then he said: “I saw all of Israel scattered amid the mountains, like sheep without a shepherd. And the Lord said: ‘These have no masters. Let each one return in peace to his own house.’ ”
2 Chronicles 18:17	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat: “Did I not tell you that this one would not prophesy to me anything good, but only what is evil?”
2 Chronicles 18:18	Then he said: “Therefore, listen to the word of the Lord. I saw the Lord sitting upon his throne, and the entire army of heaven was standing beside him, on the right and on the left.
2 Chronicles 18:19	And the Lord said: ‘Who will deceive Ahab, the king of Israel, so that he may ascend and fall at Ramoth Gilead?’ And when one spoke in one way, and another in another way,
2 Chronicles 18:20	there came forward a spirit, and he stood before the Lord and said, ‘I will deceive him.’ And the Lord said to him, ‘In what way will you deceive him?’
2 Chronicles 18:21	And he responded, ‘I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ And the Lord said: ‘You will deceive and prevail. Go forth and do so.’
2 Chronicles 18:22	Therefore now, behold: the Lord gave a lying spirit to the mouth of all your prophets, and the Lord has spoken evil about you.”
2 Chronicles 18:23	Then Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, approached, and he struck Micaiah on the jaw, and he said: “In what way did the Spirit of the Lord depart from me, so that he would speak to you?”
2 Chronicles 18:24	And Micaiah said: “You yourself shall see it, in that day, when you will enter a room within a room, so that you may be hidden.”
2 Chronicles 18:25	Then the king of Israel instructed, saying: “Take Micaiah, and lead him to Amon, the leader of the city, and to Joash, the son of Amalech.
2 Chronicles 18:26	And you shall say: ‘Thus says the king: Send this man to prison, and give to him a little bread and a little water, until I return in peace.’ ”
2 Chronicles 18:27	And Micaiah said, “If you will have returned in peace, the Lord has not spoken by me.” And he said, “May all the people listen.”
2 Chronicles 18:28	And so, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, ascended against Ramoth Gilead.
2 Chronicles 18:29	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat: “I will change my clothing, and in this way I will go into battle. But you should be clothed in your own garments.” And the king of Israel, having changed his clothing, went to war.
2 Chronicles 18:30	Now the king of Syria had instructed the commanders of his horsemen, saying, “You shall not fight against the least or the greatest, but only against the king of Israel.”
2 Chronicles 18:31	And so, when the leaders of the horsemen had seen Jehoshaphat, they said, “This one is the king of Israel.” And while fighting, they surrounded him. But he cried out to the Lord, and he assisted him, and he turned them away from him.
2 Chronicles 18:32	For when the commanders of the horsemen had seen that he was not the king of Israel, they left him.
2 Chronicles 18:33	Then it happened that one of the people shot an arrow indiscriminately, and it struck the king of Israel between the neck and the shoulder. And so he said to his chariot driver: “Turn your hand, and lead me away from the battle line. For I have been wounded.”
2 Chronicles 18:34	And the fight ended on that day. But the king of Israel was standing in his chariot facing the Syrians, even until evening. And he died when the sun set.
2 Chronicles 19:1	Then Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, returned in peace to his house in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 19:2	And the seer Jehu, the son of Hanani, met him, and said to him: “You offer assistance to the impious, and you are joined in friendship with those who hate the Lord. And for this reason, you certainly deserve the wrath of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 19:3	But good works have been found in you. For you have taken away the sacred groves from the land of Judah. And you have prepared your heart, so as to seek the Lord, the God of your fathers.”
2 Chronicles 19:4	Then Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem. And again he went out to the people, from Beersheba as far as mount Ephraim. And he called them back to the Lord, the God of their fathers.
2 Chronicles 19:5	And he appointed judges of the land, in all the fortified cities of Judah, in each place.
2 Chronicles 19:6	And instructing the judges, he said: “Pay attention to what you are doing. For you exercise judgment, not of man, but of the Lord. And whatever you will have judged, it will come back to you.
2 Chronicles 19:7	Let the fear of the Lord be with you, and do all things with diligence. For there is no iniquity with the Lord our God, nor respect of persons, nor desire for gifts.”
2 Chronicles 19:8	Jehoshaphat also appointed Levites and priests and leaders of families, out of Israel, in Jerusalem, so that they might judge the judgment and purpose of the Lord for its inhabitants.
2 Chronicles 19:9	And he instructed them, saying, “So shall you act: faithfully, in the fear of the Lord, and with a perfect heart.
2 Chronicles 19:10	Every case that will come to you from your brothers, who live in their cities, between kindred and kindred, wherever there is a question concerning law, commandment, ceremonies, or justifications, reveal it to them, so that they may not sin against the Lord, and so that wrath may not overwhelm you and your brothers. Then, by acting in this way, you will not sin.
2 Chronicles 19:11	But Amariah, a priest and your high priest, shall preside over those things which pertain to God. Then Zebadiah, the son of Ishmael, who is a ruler in the house of Judah, shall be over those works that pertain to the office of the king. And you have before you the Levites as teachers. Be strengthened and act diligently, and the Lord will be with you for what is good.”
2 Chronicles 20:1	After these things, the sons of Moab, and the sons of Ammon, and with them some from the Ammonites, gathered together so that they might fight against him.
2 Chronicles 20:2	And messengers arrived and reported to Jehoshaphat, saying: “A great multitude has arrived against you, from those places that are across the sea, and from Syria. And behold, they are standing together at Hazazon-tamar, which is Engedi.”
2 Chronicles 20:3	Then Jehoshaphat, being terrified with fear, gave himself entirely to petitioning the Lord, and he proclaimed a fast for all of Judah.
2 Chronicles 20:4	And Judah gathered together to pray to the Lord. Moreover, everyone from their cities came to beseech him.
2 Chronicles 20:5	And when Jehoshaphat had stood up in the midst of the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the Lord, before the new atrium,
2 Chronicles 20:6	he said: “O Lord, God of our fathers, you are God in heaven, and you rule over all the kingdoms of the Gentiles. In your hand is strength and power, and no one is able to withstand you.
2 Chronicles 20:7	Did not you, our God, put to death all the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel? And you gave it to the offspring of your friend Abraham, for all time.
2 Chronicles 20:8	And they lived in it. And they built a Sanctuary to your name in it, saying:
2 Chronicles 20:9	‘If evils will have fallen upon us, the sword of judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we will stand in your sight before this house, in which your name is invoked, and we will cry out to you in our tribulations. And you will heed us and accomplish our salvation.’
2 Chronicles 20:10	Now therefore, behold the sons of Ammon, and of Moab, and mount Seir, through whose lands you did not permit Israel to cross when they were departing from Egypt. Instead, they turned aside from them, and they did not put them to death.
2 Chronicles 20:11	They are doing the contrary, and they are striving to cast us from the possession which you delivered to us.
2 Chronicles 20:12	Therefore, will you, our God, not judge them? Certainly, in us there is not enough strength so that we would be able to withstand this multitude, which rushes against us. But although we do not know what we ought to do, we have this alone remaining, that we direct our eyes to you.”
2 Chronicles 20:13	Truly, all of Judah was standing before the Lord with their little ones and wives and children.
2 Chronicles 20:14	But there was Jahaziel, the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite from the sons of Asaph, upon whom the Spirit of the Lord went, in the midst of the crowd.
2 Chronicles 20:15	And he said: “Pay attention, all of Judah, and you who live in Jerusalem, and you, king Jehoshaphat. Thus says the Lord to you: Do not be afraid. Neither should you be dismayed by this multitude. For the fight is not yours, but God’s.
2 Chronicles 20:16	Tomorrow, you shall descend against them. For they will ascend along the incline named Ziz, and will find them at the summit of the torrent, which is opposite the wilderness of Jeruel.
2 Chronicles 20:17	It will not be you who will fight. Instead, only stand with confidence, and you will see the help of the Lord over you, O Judah and Jerusalem. Do not be afraid. Neither should you be dismayed. Tomorrow you shall go forth against them, and the Lord will be with you.”
2 Chronicles 20:18	Then Jehoshaphat, and Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell prone on the ground before the Lord, and they adored him.
2 Chronicles 20:19	And the Levites from the sons of Kohath, and from the sons of Korah, were praising the Lord, the God of Israel, with a great voice, on high.
2 Chronicles 20:20	And when they had risen up in the morning, they went out through the desert of Tekoa. And as they were setting out, Jehoshaphat, standing in their midst, said: “Listen to me, men of Judah and all inhabitants of Jerusalem. Believe in the Lord your God, and you will be secure. Believe in his prophets, and everything will come to prosperity.”
2 Chronicles 20:21	And he gave counsel to the people. And he appointed the singing men of the Lord, so that they would praise him by their companies, and so that they would go before the army, and with one voice say: “Confess to the Lord. For his mercy is eternal.”
2 Chronicles 20:22	And when they had begun to sing praises, the Lord turned their ambushes upon themselves, that is, those of the sons of Ammon, and of Moab, and of mount Seir, who had gone forth so that they might fight against Judah. And they were struck down.
2 Chronicles 20:23	For the sons of Ammon and of Moab rose up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, so that they might slay and destroy them. And when they had perpetrated this work, now also turning upon themselves, they cut one another with wounds.
2 Chronicles 20:24	Then, when Judah had gone to the high point that looks out toward the desert, they saw, from far away, the entire wide region filled with dead bodies. Neither was there anyone who was left alive and had been able to escape death.
2 Chronicles 20:25	Therefore, Jehoshaphat went, and all the people with him, in order to take away the spoils of the dead. And they found, among the dead bodies, diverse equipment, and also garments, and very precious vessels. And they despoiled these, to such an extent that they were unable to carry everything. Neither could they, over three days, take away the spoils because of the magnitude of the plunder.
2 Chronicles 20:26	Then, on the fourth day, they were gathered together in the Valley of Blessing. For they had blessed the Lord there, and therefore they called that place the Valley of Blessing, even to the present day.
2 Chronicles 20:27	And every man of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, returned, with Jehoshaphat before them, to Jerusalem, with great rejoicing. For the Lord had granted to them gladness concerning their enemies.
2 Chronicles 20:28	And they entered into Jerusalem with psalteries, and harps, and trumpets, into the house of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 20:29	Then the fear of the Lord fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands, when they had heard that the Lord had fought against the enemies of Israel.
2 Chronicles 20:30	And the kingdom of Jehoshaphat was quiet. And God granted to him peace on all sides.
2 Chronicles 20:31	And so Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. And he was thirty-five years old when he had begun to reign. Then he reigned for twenty-five years in Jerusalem. And the name of his mother was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi.
2 Chronicles 20:32	And he walked in the way of his father, Asa, and he did not decline from it, doing the things that were pleasing before the Lord.
2 Chronicles 20:33	Yet truly, he did not take away the high places, and the people still had not directed their heart to the Lord, the God of their fathers.
2 Chronicles 20:34	But the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, the first and the last, have been written in the words of Jehu, the son of Hanani, which he digested into the books of the kings of Israel.
2 Chronicles 20:35	After these things, Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, formed a friendship with Ahaziah, the king of Israel, whose works were very impious.
2 Chronicles 20:36	And he was a partner in the making of ships, which would go to Tarshish. And they made the fleet at Eziongeber.
2 Chronicles 20:37	Then Eliezer, the son of Dodavahu, from Mareshah, prophesied to Jehoshaphat, saying: “Because you have made a pact with Ahaziah, the Lord has struck your works, and the ships have been broken, and they have not been able to go to Tarshish.”
2 Chronicles 21:1	Then Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and he was buried with them in the City of David. And his son, Jehoram, reigned in his place.
2 Chronicles 21:2	And he had brothers, sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah. All these were sons of Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah.
2 Chronicles 21:3	And their father gave to them many gifts of silver, and gold, and valuables, with very fortified cities in Judah. But the kingdom he handed on to Jehoram, because he was the firstborn.
2 Chronicles 21:4	Therefore, Jehoram rose up over the kingdom of his father. And when he had established himself, he killed with the sword all his brothers, and certain ones from the leaders of Israel.
2 Chronicles 21:5	Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he had begun to reign. And he reigned for eight years in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 21:6	And he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had done. For his wife was a daughter of Ahab, and he did evil in the sight of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 21:7	But the Lord was not willing to destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had formed with him, and because he had promised that he would provide a lamp to him, and to his sons, for all time.
2 Chronicles 21:8	In those days, Edom rebelled, so as not to be subject to Judah, and they appointed for themselves a king.
2 Chronicles 21:9	And when Jehoram had gone across with his leaders, and all the horsemen who were with him, he arose in the night, and struck the Edomites (who had surrounded him), and all the commanders of his horsemen.
2 Chronicles 21:10	Even so, Edom rebelled, so as not to be under the authority of Judah, even to this day. Also at that time, Libnah withdrew, so as not to be under his hand. For he had forsaken the Lord, the God of his fathers.
2 Chronicles 21:11	Moreover, he also constructed high places in the cities of Judah. And he caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to fornicate, and Judah to prevaricate.
2 Chronicles 21:12	Then letters were conveyed to him from the prophet Elijah, in which it was written: “Thus says the Lord, the God of David, your father: Because you have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat, your father, nor in the ways of Asa, the king of Judah,
2 Chronicles 21:13	but instead you have advanced along the paths of the kings of Israel, and you have caused Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to fornicate, imitating the fornication of the house of Ahab, and moreover, you have killed your brothers, the house of your father, who are better than you:
2 Chronicles 21:14	behold, the Lord will strike you with a great plague, with all your people, and your sons and wives, and all your substance.
2 Chronicles 21:15	And you shall be sickened by a very grievous disease of your bowels, until your inner organs depart, little by little, each day.”
2 Chronicles 21:16	Therefore, the Lord stirred up, against Jehoram, the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, who are along the borders of the Ethiopians.
2 Chronicles 21:17	And they ascended into the land of Judah. And they laid waste to it. And they despoiled all the substance that was found in the house of the king, including even his sons and wives. Neither did there remain for him any son, except Jehoahaz, who was the youngest born.
2 Chronicles 21:18	And in addition to all these things, the Lord struck him with an incurable disease of the bowels.
2 Chronicles 21:19	And as day followed after day, and the space of time turned, the course of two years was completed. And after having been wasted by a long consumption, so much so that even his inner organs were discharged, the disease ended along with his life. And so he died of a very grievous illness. And the people did not make a funeral for him, according to the custom of burning, as they had done for his ancestors.
2 Chronicles 21:20	He was thirty-two years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for eight years in Jerusalem. And he did not walk uprightly. And they buried him in the City of David, yet truly, not in the sepulcher of the kings.
2 Chronicles 22:1	Then the inhabitants of Jerusalem appointed his youngest son, Ahaziah, as king in his place. For the robbers of the Arabians, who had fallen upon the camp, had put to death all those who were greater by birth before him. And so Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram, reigned as king of Judah.
2 Chronicles 22:2	Ahaziah was forty-two years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for one year in Jerusalem. And the name of his mother was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri.
2 Chronicles 22:3	But he too went forth in the ways of the house of Ahab. For his mother impelled him to act impiously.
2 Chronicles 22:4	And so he did evil in the sight of the Lord, just as the house of Ahab did. For after the death of his father, they were counselors to him, to his destruction.
2 Chronicles 22:5	And he walked in their counsels. And he went with Joram, the son of Ahab, the king of Israel, to war against Hazael, the king of Syria, at Ramoth Gilead. And the Syrians wounded Joram.
2 Chronicles 22:6	And he returned, so that he might be cured at Jezreel. For he had received many wounds in the above-stated battle. And so Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram, the king of Judah, descended, so that he might visit Joram, the son of Ahab, at Jezreel, while he was ill.
2 Chronicles 22:7	Indeed, it was the will of God against Ahaziah that he would go to Joram, and when he had gone, that he also would go out with him against Jehu, the son of Nimshi, whom the Lord had anointed to destroy the house of Ahab.
2 Chronicles 22:8	Therefore, when Jehu was overthrowing the house of Ahab, he found the leaders of Judah, with the sons of the brothers of Ahaziah, who were ministering to him, and he put them to death.
2 Chronicles 22:9	Also, while he himself was seeking Ahaziah, he found him to be hiding in Samaria. And having been led to him, he killed him. And they buried him, because he was the son of Jehoshaphat, who had sought the Lord with all his heart. But there was no longer any hope that someone from the stock of Ahaziah would reign.
2 Chronicles 22:10	For indeed, his mother, Athaliah, seeing that her son had died, rose up and killed the entire royal stock of the house of Jehoram.
2 Chronicles 22:11	But Jehosheba, the daughter of the king, took Joash, the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from the midst the king’s sons when they were being slain. And she hid him with his nurse in a bedroom. Now Jehosheba, the one who had hidden him, was the daughter of king Jehoram, and the wife of the high priest Jehoiada, and the sister of Ahaziah. And because of this, Athaliah did not kill him.
2 Chronicles 22:12	Therefore, he was with them, hidden in the house of God, for six years, while Athaliah reigned over the land.
2 Chronicles 23:1	Then in the seventh year, Jehoiada having been strengthened, he took the centurions, namely, Azariah, the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael, the son of Jehohanan, and also Azariah, the son of Obed, and Maaseiah, the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat, the son of Zichri, and he formed a pact with them.
2 Chronicles 23:2	And traveling through Judah, they gathered together the Levites from all of the cities of Judah, and the leaders of the families of Israel, and they went to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 23:3	Then the entire multitude formed a pact with the king, in the house of God. And Jehoiada said to them: “Behold, the son of the king shall reign, just as the Lord has said concerning the sons of David.
2 Chronicles 23:4	Therefore, this is the word that you shall do:
2 Chronicles 23:5	One third part of you who arrive on the Sabbath, priests, and Levites, and porters, shall be at the gates. Truly, one third part shall be at the house of the king. And one third shall be at the gate which is called the Foundation. Yet truly, let all the remainder of the common people be in the courts of the house of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 23:6	Let no one else enter into the house of the Lord, except the priests, and those from the Levites who are ministering. These alone may enter, for they have been sanctified. And let all the remainder of the common people observe the watches of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 23:7	Then let the Levites encircle the king, each one having his weapons. And if anyone else will have entered into the temple, let him be slain. And may they be with the king, both entering and departing.”
2 Chronicles 23:8	Then the Levites, and all of Judah, acted in accord with all that the high priest Jehoiada had instructed. And each of them took the men who were under him, and who were arriving by the course of the Sabbath, with those who had fulfilled the Sabbath and who were about to depart. For indeed the high priest Jehoiada had not permitted the companies to depart, which were accustomed to replace one another each week.
2 Chronicles 23:9	And Jehoiada, the priest, gave to the centurions the lances and round shields and crescent shields of king David, which he had dedicated in the house of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 23:10	And he positioned all the people, holding short swords, from the right part of the temple to the left part of the temple, before the altar and the temple, all around the king.
2 Chronicles 23:11	And they led out the son of the king. And they imposed the diadem on him, and the testimony. And they gave him the law to hold in his hand. And they appointed him as king. Also, the high priest Jehoiada and his sons anointed him. And they prayed for him, and said, “May the king live!”
2 Chronicles 23:12	And when Athaliah had heard it, specifically the sound of running and the praising of the king, she entered to the people in the temple of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 23:13	And when she had seen the king standing upon the step at the entrance, and the leaders and companies around him, and all the people of the land rejoicing, and sounding the trumpets, and playing on instruments of various kinds, and the voice of those who were praising, she tore her garments, and she said: “Treason! Treason!”
2 Chronicles 23:14	Then the high priest Jehoiada, going out to the centurions and to the leaders of the army, said to them: “Lead her away, beyond the borders of the temple. And let her be put to death outside, with the sword.” And the priest instructed that she should not be killed in the house of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 23:15	And they laid hands on her neck. And when she had entered the gate for the horses at the king’s house, they put her to death there.
2 Chronicles 23:16	Then Jehoiada formed a covenant between himself and the entire people, and the king, so that they would be the people of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 23:17	And so, all the people entered into the house of Baal, and they destroyed it. And they broke apart his altars and idols. Also, they put to death Mattan, the priest of Baal, before the altars.
2 Chronicles 23:18	Then Jehoiada appointed overseers in the house of the Lord, under the hands of the priests and Levites, whom David had distributed to the house of the Lord so that they might offer holocausts to the Lord, just as it was written in the law of Moses, with gladness and singing, in accord with the disposition of David.
2 Chronicles 23:19	Also, he appointed porters at the gates of the house of the Lord, so that whoever was unclean for any reason would not enter.
2 Chronicles 23:20	And he took the centurions, and the most valiant men, and the leaders of the people, and all the common people of the land, and they set out to descend to the king, from the house of the Lord, and to enter through the middle of the upper gate, to the house of the king. And they placed him on the royal throne.
2 Chronicles 23:21	And all the people of the land were rejoicing, and the city was quieted. But Athaliah was slain with the sword.
2 Chronicles 24:1	Joash was seven years old when he had begun to reign. And he reigned for forty years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Zibiah, from Beersheba.
2 Chronicles 24:2	And he did what is good before the Lord during all the days of Jehoiada, the priest.
2 Chronicles 24:3	Now Jehoiada gave to him two wives, from whom he conceived sons and daughters.
2 Chronicles 24:4	After these things, it pleased Joash to repair the house of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 24:5	And he gathered together the priests and Levites, and he said to them: “Go out to the cities of Judah, and collect from all of Israel money to repair the surfaces of the temple of your God, throughout each year. And do this promptly.” But the Levites acted negligently.
2 Chronicles 24:6	And the king summoned Jehoiada, the leader, and he said to him: “Why was there no concern with you, so that you would compel the Levites to bring, from Judah and from Jerusalem, the money that was appointed by Moses, the servant of the Lord, so as to bring it, from the entire multitude of Israel, to the tabernacle of the testimony?
2 Chronicles 24:7	For that very impious woman Athaliah and her sons have destroyed the house of God, and they have adorned the shrine of Baal from all the things that had been sanctified in the temple of the Lord.”
2 Chronicles 24:8	Therefore, the king instructed, and they made an ark. And they placed it beside the gate of the house of the Lord, on the outside.
2 Chronicles 24:9	And they proclaimed, in Judah and Jerusalem, that each one should bring to the Lord the money that Moses, the servant of God, appointed in the desert, concerning all of Israel.
2 Chronicles 24:10	And all the leaders and all the people rejoiced. And upon entering, they together took and placed so much into the ark of the Lord that it was filled.
2 Chronicles 24:11	And when it was time for them to bring the ark before the king by the hands of the Levites, for they saw that there was much money, the scribe of the king, and the one whom the high priest had appointed, entered. And they poured out the money that was in the ark. Then they carried the ark back to its place. And they did this on each day. And an immense sum of money was gathered.
2 Chronicles 24:12	And the king and Jehoiada gave it to those who were in charge of the works of the house of the Lord. Then with it they hired hewers of stone, and artisans of every kind, so that they might repair the house of the Lord, and also so that the works of iron and of brass, which had begun to fall, would be reinforced.
2 Chronicles 24:13	And those who were hired were working industriously. And the breach in the walls was healed by their hands. And they returned the house of the Lord to a pristine state. And they caused it stand firm.
2 Chronicles 24:14	And when they had completed all the works, they brought the remaining part of the money before the king and Jehoiada. And from it, the vessels of the temple were made, for the ministry and for the holocausts, including bowls and other vessels of gold and silver. And holocausts were being offered in the house of the Lord continually, during all the days of Jehoiada.
2 Chronicles 24:15	But Jehoiada was old and full of days. And he died when he was one hundred thirty years old.
2 Chronicles 24:16	And they buried him in the City of David, with the kings, because he had done good to Israel and to his house.
2 Chronicles 24:17	Then, after Jehoiada passed away, the leaders of Judah entered and reverenced the king. And he was enticed by their obsequiousness, and so he acquiesced to them.
2 Chronicles 24:18	And they abandoned the temple of the Lord, the God of their fathers, and they served sacred groves and graven images. And wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem because of this sin.
2 Chronicles 24:19	And he sent prophets to them, so that they might return to the Lord. And though they were offering testimony, they were not willing to listen to them.
2 Chronicles 24:20	And so the Spirit of God clothed Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada the priest. And he stood in the sight of the people, and he said to them: “Thus says the Lord God: Why have you transgressed the precept of the Lord, though it was not to your benefit, and why have you abandoned the Lord, so that he would then abandon you?”
2 Chronicles 24:21	And gathering together against him, they stoned him, beside the place of the king, in the atrium of the house of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 24:22	And king Joash did not remember the mercy with which Jehoiada, his father, had treated him; instead he put to death his son. And as he was dying, he said: “May the Lord see and take account.”
2 Chronicles 24:23	And when a year had turned, the army of Syria ascended against him. And they went to Judah and Jerusalem. And they put to death all the leaders of the people. And they sent all the spoils to the king of Damascus.
2 Chronicles 24:24	And although certainly there had arrived a very small number of Syrians, the Lord delivered into their hands an immense multitude. For they had forsaken the Lord, the God of their fathers. Also, against Joash they executed disgraceful judgments.
2 Chronicles 24:25	And upon departing, they left him greatly debilitated. Then his servants rose up against him, in vengeance for the blood of the son of Jehoiada the priest. And they killed him on his bed, and he died. And they buried him in the City of David, but not in the sepulchers of the kings.
2 Chronicles 24:26	Truly, those who ambushed him were Zabad, the son of an Ammonite woman named Shimeath, and Jehozabad, the son of a Moabite woman named Shimrith.
2 Chronicles 24:27	But concerning his sons, and the sum of money that had been amassed under him, and the repairing of the house of God, these things have been written more diligently in the book of kings. Then his son, Amaziah, reigned in his place.
2 Chronicles 25:1	Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he had begun to reign. And he reigned for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Jehoaddan, from Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 25:2	And he accomplished good in the sight of the Lord. Yet truly, not with a perfect heart.
2 Chronicles 25:3	And when he saw himself to be strengthened in his rule, he cut the throats of the servants who had killed his father, the king.
2 Chronicles 25:4	But he did not put to death their sons, just as it was written in the book of the law of Moses, where the Lord instructed, saying: “The fathers shall not be slain because of the sons, nor the sons because of their fathers. Instead, each one shall die for his own sin.”
2 Chronicles 25:5	And then Amaziah gathered together Judah, and he organized them by families, and tribunes, and centurions, throughout all of Judah and Benjamin. And he numbered them from twenty years old and upward. And he found three hundred thousand young men, who could go forth to battle, and who could hold spear and shield.
2 Chronicles 25:6	Also, he hired for pay from Israel one hundred thousand experienced men, for one hundred talents of silver.
2 Chronicles 25:7	Then a man of God came to him, and he said: “O king, let not the army of Israel go forth with you. For the Lord is not with Israel, nor with all the sons of Ephraim.
2 Chronicles 25:8	But if you think that a war stands by the strength of the army, God will cause you to be overwhelmed by the enemies. For indeed, it belongs to God to assist, and to put to flight.”
2 Chronicles 25:9	And Amaziah said to the man of God, “Then what will become of the one hundred talents, which I gave to the soldiers of Israel?” And the man of God responded to him, “The Lord has that from which he is able to give much more than this to you.”
2 Chronicles 25:10	And so, Amaziah separated the army, which had come to him from Ephraim, so that they would return to their place. But having become very angry against Judah, they returned to their own region.
2 Chronicles 25:11	Then Amaziah confidently led forth his people. And he went away to the Valley of the Salt Pits, and he struck down ten thousand of the sons of Seir.
2 Chronicles 25:12	And the sons of Judah captured another ten thousand of the men. And they led them to the precipice of a certain rock. And they threw them from the summit, and they were all broken apart.
2 Chronicles 25:13	But the army that Amaziah had sent away, so that they would not go with him into battle, spread out among the cities of Judah, from Samaria as far as Beth-horon. And having killed three thousand, they took away much plunder.
2 Chronicles 25:14	Truly, after the slaughter of the Edomites, and when the gods of the sons of Seir were brought, Amaziah chose them as gods for himself. And he was adoring them, and burning incense to them.
2 Chronicles 25:15	For this reason, the Lord became angry against Amaziah, and he sent a prophet to him, who would say to him, “Why have you adored gods who did not free their own people from your hand?”
2 Chronicles 25:16	And after he spoke these things, he responded to him: “Are you the counselor of the king? Be quiet! Otherwise I will put you to death.” And departing, the prophet said, “I know that God has decided to kill you, because you have done this evil, and also because you have not agreed to my counsel.”
2 Chronicles 25:17	And so Amaziah, the king of Judah, undertaking a very wicked counsel, sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, the king of Israel, saying: “Come, let us see one another.”
2 Chronicles 25:18	But he sent back messengers, saying: “The thistle which is in Lebanon sent to the cedar of Lebanon, saying: ‘Give your daughter to my son as wife.’ And behold, the beasts that were in the forest of Lebanon passed through, and they trampled the thistle.
2 Chronicles 25:19	You said, ‘I struck down Edom.’ And for this reason, your heart is lifted up with pride. Settle in your own house. Why do you provoke evil against yourself, so that you may fall, and then Judah with you?”
2 Chronicles 25:20	Amaziah was not willing to listen to him, because it was the will of the Lord that he be delivered into the hands of the enemies, because of the gods of Edom.
2 Chronicles 25:21	And so Joash, the king of Israel, ascended, and they presented themselves within the sight of one another. Now Amaziah, the king of Judah, was in Beth-shemesh of Judah.
2 Chronicles 25:22	And Judah fell before Israel. And each one fled to his own tent.
2 Chronicles 25:23	Then Joash, the king of Israel, captured Amaziah, the king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and he led him to Jerusalem. And he destroyed its walls, from the gate of Ephraim as far as the gate of the corner, four hundred cubits.
2 Chronicles 25:24	Also, he brought back to Samaria all the gold and silver, and all the vessels, which he had found in the house of God, and with Obededom in the treasuries of the king’s house, as well as sons for hostages.
2 Chronicles 25:25	Then Amaziah, the son of Joash, the king of Judah, lived for fifteen years after the death of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the king of Israel.
2 Chronicles 25:26	Now the rest of the words of Amaziah, the first and the last, have been written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
2 Chronicles 25:27	And after he withdrew from the Lord, they set up an ambush against him in Jerusalem. But since he had fled into Lachish, they sent and killed him in that place.
2 Chronicles 25:28	And having carried him back upon horses, they buried him with his fathers in the City of David.
2 Chronicles 26:1	Then all the people of Judah appointed his son, Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, as king in place of his father, Amaziah.
2 Chronicles 26:2	He built up Eloth, and he restored it to the dominion of Judah. After this, the king slept with his fathers.
2 Chronicles 26:3	Uzziah was sixteen years old when he had begun to reign. And he reigned for fifty-two years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Jecoliah, from Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 26:4	And he did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, in accord with all that his father, Amaziah, had done.
2 Chronicles 26:5	And he sought the Lord, during the days of Zechariah, who understood and saw God. And while he was seeking the Lord, he directed him in all things.
2 Chronicles 26:6	Indeed, he went out and fought against the Philistines. And he destroyed the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod. Also, he built towns in Ashdod, and among the Philistines.
2 Chronicles 26:7	And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians, who were living in Gurbaal, and against the Ammonites.
2 Chronicles 26:8	And the Ammonites weighed out gifts to Uzziah. And his name became widely known, even to the entrance of Egypt, because of his frequent victories.
2 Chronicles 26:9	And Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem, above the gate of the corner, and above the gate of the valley, and others on the same side of the wall, and he fortified them.
2 Chronicles 26:10	Then he also constructed towers in the wilderness, and dug many cisterns, because he had much cattle, both in the plains and in the starkness of the wilderness. Also, he had vineyards and dressers of vines in the mountains and at Carmel. Certainly, he was a man devoted to agriculture.
2 Chronicles 26:11	Now the army of his warriors, who would go forth to battle, was under the hand of Jeiel, the scribe, and Maaseiah, the teacher, and under the hand of Hananiah, who was among the king’s commanders.
2 Chronicles 26:12	And the entire number of the leaders, by the families of strong men, was two thousand six hundred.
2 Chronicles 26:13	And the entire army under them was three hundred and seven thousand five hundred, who were fit for war, and who fought on behalf of the king against the adversaries.
2 Chronicles 26:14	Also, Uzziah prepared for them, that is, for the entire army, shields, and spears, and helmets, and breastplates, and bows, as well as slings for the casting of stones.
2 Chronicles 26:15	And in Jerusalem, he made various kinds of machines, which he placed in the towers, and at the corners of the walls, so as to shoot arrows and large stones. And his name went forth to far away places, for the Lord was helping him and had strengthened him.
2 Chronicles 26:16	But when he had become strong, his heart was lifted up, even to his own destruction. And he neglected the Lord his God. And entering into the temple of the Lord, he intended to burn incense upon the altar of incense.
2 Chronicles 26:17	And entering immediately after him, Azariah the priest, and with him eighty priests of the Lord, very valiant men,
2 Chronicles 26:18	withstood the king, and they said: “It is not your office, Uzziah, to burn incense to the Lord; rather, it is the office of the priests, that is, of the sons of Aaron, who have been consecrated for this same ministry. Depart from the sanctuary, otherwise you will be in contempt. For this act will not be reputed to you for your glory by the Lord God.”
2 Chronicles 26:19	And Uzziah, having become angry, while holding in his hand the censer so that he might burn incense, threatened the priests. And immediately a leprosy arose on his forehead, in the sight of the priests, in the house of the Lord, at the altar of incense.
2 Chronicles 26:20	And when the high priest Azariah, and all the rest of the priests, had gazed upon him, they saw the leprosy on his forehead, and they hurried to expel him. Then too, he himself, becoming terrified, rushed to depart, because immediately he had become aware of the wound of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 26:21	And so, king Uzziah was a leper, even until the day of his death. And he lived in a separate house, being full of leprosy, because of which he had been ejected from the house of the Lord. Then Jotham, his son, directed the house of the king, and he was judging the people of the land.
2 Chronicles 26:22	But the rest of the words of Uzziah, the first and the last, were written by the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz.
2 Chronicles 26:23	And Uzziah slept with his fathers. And they buried him in the field of the royal sepulchers, because he was a leper. And Jotham, his son, reigned in his place.
2 Chronicles 27:1	Jotham was twenty-five years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok.
2 Chronicles 27:2	And he did what was right before the Lord, in accord with all that his father, Uzziah, had done, except that he did not enter into the temple of the Lord, and still the people were transgressing.
2 Chronicles 27:3	He improved the high gate of the house of the Lord. And he built many things upon the wall of Ophel.
2 Chronicles 27:4	Also, he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and fortresses and towers in the forests.
2 Chronicles 27:5	He fought against the king of the sons of Ammon, and he defeated them. And at that time, the sons of Ammon gave to him one hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand cor of wheat, and the same number of cor of barley. These things the sons of Ammon offered to him in the second and third year.
2 Chronicles 27:6	And Jotham was strengthened, because he had directed his way before the Lord his God.
2 Chronicles 27:7	Now the rest of the words of Jotham, and all his battles and works, have been written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
2 Chronicles 27:8	He was twenty-five years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 27:9	And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the City of David. And his son, Ahaz, reigned in his place.
2 Chronicles 28:1	Ahaz was twenty years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. He did not do what is right in the sight of the Lord, as his father David did.
2 Chronicles 28:2	Instead, he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel. Moreover, he also cast statues for the Baals.
2 Chronicles 28:3	It is he who burned incense in the Valley of the son of Hinnom. And he purified his sons by fire, in accord with the ritual of the nations that the Lord put to death at the advent of the sons of Israel.
2 Chronicles 28:4	Also, he was sacrificing and burning incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every leafy tree.
2 Chronicles 28:5	And so the Lord, his God, delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria, who struck him and took great plunder from his kingdom. And he carried it away to Damascus. Also, he was delivered into the hands of the king of Israel, and he struck him with great affliction.
2 Chronicles 28:6	And Pekah, the son of Remaliah, killed, on one day, one hundred twenty thousand, all of them men of war from Judah, because they had forsaken the Lord, the God of their fathers.
2 Chronicles 28:7	In the same time, Zichri, a powerful man of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah, the son of the king, and Azrikam, the governor of his house, and also Elkanah, who was second to the king.
2 Chronicles 28:8	And the sons of Israel seized, from their brothers, two hundred thousand women, boys, and girls, and immense plunder. And they took it away to Samaria.
2 Chronicles 28:9	At that time, there was a prophet of the Lord there, named Oded. And going out to meet the army arriving in Samaria, he said to them: “Behold, the Lord, the God of your fathers, having become angry against Judah, has delivered them into your hands. But you have killed them by atrocities, so that your cruelty has reached up to heaven.
2 Chronicles 28:10	Moreover, you wanted to subjugate the sons of Judah and Jerusalem as your men and women servants, which is a work that should never be done. And so you sinned in this matter against the Lord your God.
2 Chronicles 28:11	But listen to my counsel, and release the captives, whom you have brought from your brothers. For a great fury of the Lord is hanging over you.”
2 Chronicles 28:12	And so, some of the leaders of the sons of Ephraim, Azariah, the son of Johanan, Berechiah, the son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah, the son of Shallum, and Amasa, the son of Hadlai, stood up against those who were arriving from the battle.
2 Chronicles 28:13	And they said to them: “You shall not lead back captives to here, lest we sin against the Lord. Why are you willing to add to our sins, and to build upon our old offenses? For indeed, the sin is great, and the furious anger of the Lord is hanging over Israel.”
2 Chronicles 28:14	And the warriors released the spoils and all that they had seized, in the sight of the leaders and the entire multitude.
2 Chronicles 28:15	And the men, whom we mentioned above, rose up and took the captives. All those who were naked, they clothed from the spoils. And when they had clothed them, and had given them shoes, and had refreshed them with food and drink, and had anointed them because of the hardship, and had cared for them, whoever was not able to walk and whoever was feeble in body, they set them upon beasts of burden, and they led them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brothers, and they themselves returned to Samaria.
2 Chronicles 28:16	In that time, king Ahaz sent to the king of the Assyrians, requesting assistance.
2 Chronicles 28:17	And the Edomites arrived and struck down many of Judah, and they seized great plunder.
2 Chronicles 28:18	Also, the Philistines spread out among the cities of the plains, and to the south of Judah. And they seized Beth-shemesh, and Aijalon, and Gederoth, and also Soco, and Timnah, and Gimzo, with their villages, and they lived in them.
2 Chronicles 28:19	For the Lord had humbled Judah because of Ahaz, the king of Judah, since he had stripped it of help, and had shown contempt for the Lord.
2 Chronicles 28:20	And he led against him Tilgath-pilneser, the king of the Assyrians, who also afflicted him and laid waste to him, without resistance.
2 Chronicles 28:21	And so Ahaz, despoiling the house of the Lord, and the house of the kings and the leaders, gave gifts to the king of the Assyrians, and yet it profited him nothing.
2 Chronicles 28:22	Moreover, in the time of his anguish, he also added to his contempt against the Lord. King Ahaz himself, by himself,
2 Chronicles 28:23	immolated victims to the gods of Damascus, those who had struck him. And he said: “The gods of the kings of Syria assist them, and so I will please them with victims, and they will help me.” But to the contrary, they had been the ruin of him and of all Israel.
2 Chronicles 28:24	And so, Ahaz, having despoiled and broken apart all the vessels of the house of God, closed up the doors of the temple of God, and made for himself altars in all the corners of Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 28:25	Also, he constructed altars in all the cities of Judah, in order to burn frankincense, and so he provoked the Lord, the God of his fathers, to wrath.
2 Chronicles 28:26	But the rest of his words, and all his works, the first and the last, have been written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
2 Chronicles 28:27	And Ahaz slept with his fathers. And they buried him in the city of Jerusalem. And they did not allow him to be in the sepulchers of the kings of Israel. And his son, Hezekiah, reigned in his place.
2 Chronicles 29:1	And so Hezekiah began to reign when he was twenty-five years old. And he reigned for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.
2 Chronicles 29:2	And he did what was pleasing in the sight of the Lord, in accord with all that his father David had done.
2 Chronicles 29:3	In the first year and month of his reign, he opened the double doors of the house of the Lord, and he repaired them.
2 Chronicles 29:4	And he brought together the priests and Levites. And he gathered them in the wide eastern street.
2 Chronicles 29:5	And he said to them: “Listen to me, O Levites, and be sanctified. Cleanse the house of the Lord, the God of your fathers, and take away every uncleanness from the sanctuary.
2 Chronicles 29:6	Our fathers sinned and did evil in the sight of the Lord our God, abandoning him. They turned their faces away from the tabernacle of the Lord, and they presented their backs.
2 Chronicles 29:7	They closed up the doors which were in the portico, and they extinguished the lamps. And they did not burn incense, and they did not offer holocausts, in the sanctuary of the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles 29:8	And so the fury of the Lord was stirred up against Judah and Jerusalem, and he handed them over to turmoil, and to destruction, and to hissing, just as you discern with your own eyes.
2 Chronicles 29:9	Lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword. Our sons, and our daughters and wives have been led away as captives because of this wickedness.
2 Chronicles 29:10	Now therefore, it is pleasing to me that we should enter into a covenant with the Lord, the God of Israel. And he will turn away the fury of his indignation from us.
2 Chronicles 29:11	My sons, do not choose to be negligent. The Lord has chosen you so that you would stand before him, and minister to him, and worship him, and burn incense to him.”
2 Chronicles 29:12	Therefore, the Levites rose up, Mahath, the son of Amasai, and Joel, the son of Azariah, from the sons of Kohath; then, from the sons of Merari, Kish, the son of Abdi, and Azariah, the son of Jehallelel; and from the sons of Gershon, Joah, the son of Zimmah, and Eden, the son of Joah;
2 Chronicles 29:13	and truly, from the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeuel; also, from the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;
2 Chronicles 29:14	indeed also, from the sons of Heman, Jehuel and Shimei; then too, from the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel.
2 Chronicles 29:15	And they gathered together their brothers. And they were sanctified. And they entered in accord with the command of the king and the order of the Lord, so that they might expiate the house of God.
2 Chronicles 29:16	And the priests, entering the temple of the Lord so that they might sanctify it, took every uncleanness, which they had found inside, out to the vestibule of the house of the Lord; and the Levites took it away and transported it outside, to the torrent Kidron.
2 Chronicles 29:17	Now they began to cleanse on the first day of the first month. And on the eighth day of the same month, they entered the portico of the temple of the Lord. And then they expiated the temple over eight days. And on the sixteenth day of the same month, they finished what they had begun.
2 Chronicles 29:18	Also, they entered to king Hezekiah, and they said to him: “We have sanctified the entire house of the Lord, and the altar of holocaust, and its vessels, indeed also the table of the presence, with all its vessels,
2 Chronicles 29:19	and all the equipment of the temple, which king Ahaz, during his reign, had polluted after his transgression. And behold, these have all been set forth before the altar of the Lord.”
2 Chronicles 29:20	And rising up at first light, king Hezekiah joined as one all the leaders of the city, and they ascended to the house of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 29:21	And together they offered seven bulls and seven rams, seven lambs and seven he-goats, for sin, for the kingdom, for the Sanctuary, for Judah. And he spoke to the priests, the sons of Aaron, so that they would offer these upon the altar of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 29:22	And so they slaughtered the bulls. And the priests took up the blood, and they poured it upon the altar. Then they also slaughtered the rams, and they poured their blood upon the altar. And they immolated the lambs, and they poured the blood upon the altar.
2 Chronicles 29:23	They brought the he-goats for sin before the king and the entire multitude. And they laid their hands upon them.
2 Chronicles 29:24	And the priests immolated them, and they sprinkled their blood before the altar, for the expiation of all Israel. For certainly the king had instructed that the holocaust and the sin offering should be made on behalf of all Israel.
2 Chronicles 29:25	Also, he situated the Levites in the house of the Lord, with cymbals, and psalteries, and harps, according to the disposition of king David, and of the seer Gad, and of the prophet Nathan. For indeed, this was the precept of the Lord, by the hand of his prophets.
2 Chronicles 29:26	And the Levites stood, holding the musical instruments of David, and the priests held the trumpets.
2 Chronicles 29:27	And Hezekiah ordered that they should offer holocausts upon the altar. And when the holocausts were being offered, they began to sing praises to the Lord, and to sound the trumpets, and to play various musical instruments, which David, the king of Israel, had prepared.
2 Chronicles 29:28	Then the entire crowd was adoring, and the singers and those who were holding the trumpeters were exercising their office, until the holocaust was completed.
2 Chronicles 29:29	And when the oblation was finished, the king, and all who were with him, bowed down and adored.
2 Chronicles 29:30	And Hezekiah and the rulers instructed the Levites to praise the Lord with the words of David, and of Asaph, the seer. And they praised him with great joy, and kneeling down, they adored.
2 Chronicles 29:31	And now Hezekiah also added: “You have filled your hands for the Lord. Draw near, and offer victims and praises in the house of the Lord.” Therefore, the entire multitude offered victims and praises and holocausts, with devout intention.
2 Chronicles 29:32	Now the number of the holocausts that the multitude offered was seventy bulls, one hundred rams, two hundred lambs.
2 Chronicles 29:33	And they sanctified to the Lord six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.
2 Chronicles 29:34	Truly, the priests were few; neither were they sufficient to remove the pelts from the holocausts. Therefore, the Levites, their brothers, also assisted them, until the work was completed, and the priests, who were of higher rank, were sanctified. For indeed, the Levites are sanctified with an easier ritual than the priests.
2 Chronicles 29:35	Thus, there were very numerous holocausts, with the fat of the peace offerings and the libations of the holocausts. And the service of the house of the Lord was completed.
2 Chronicles 29:36	And Hezekiah and all the people were joyful because the ministry of the Lord was accomplished. For certainly, it had pleased them to do this suddenly.
2 Chronicles 30:1	Also, Hezekiah sent to all of Israel and Judah. And he wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh, so that they would come to the house of the Lord in Jerusalem, and so that they would keep the Passover to the Lord, the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles 30:2	Therefore, having taken counsel, the king and the rulers, and the entire assembly of Jerusalem, resolved that they would keep the Passover, in the second month.
2 Chronicles 30:3	For they had not been able to keep it at its proper time. For the priests, who were unable to suffice, had not been sanctified. And the people had not yet been gathered together in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 30:4	And the word was pleasing to the king, and to the entire multitude.
2 Chronicles 30:5	And they resolved that they would send messengers to all of Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, so that they might come and keep the Passover to the Lord, the God of Israel, at Jerusalem. For many had not kept it, just as it was prescribed by the law.
2 Chronicles 30:6	And carriers traveled with the letters, by order of the king and his rulers, to all of Israel and Judah, proclaiming, in accord with what the king had ordered: “O sons of Israel, return to the Lord, the God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Israel. And he will return to the remnant who escaped from the hand of the king of the Assyrians.
2 Chronicles 30:7	Do not choose to be like your fathers and brothers, who withdrew from the Lord, the God of their fathers. And so he delivered them over to destruction, as you yourselves discern.
2 Chronicles 30:8	Do not choose to harden your necks, as your fathers did. Surrender to the hands of the Lord. And go to his Sanctuary, which he has sanctified unto eternity. Serve the Lord, the God of your fathers, and the fury of his wrath will be turned away from you.
2 Chronicles 30:9	For if you will return to the Lord, your brothers and sons will find mercy before their masters, who led them away as captives, and they will be returned to this land. For the Lord your God is compassionate and lenient, and he will not avert his face from you, if you will return to him.”
2 Chronicles 30:10	And so, the carriers were traveling quickly from city to city, throughout the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, as far as Zebulun, though they were ridiculing and mocking them.
2 Chronicles 30:11	Even so, certain men from Asher, and from Manasseh, and from Zebulun, acquiescing to this counsel, went to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 30:12	Truly, the hand of God was working in Judah, to give them one heart, so that they would accomplish the word of the Lord, according to the precept of the king and of the rulers.
2 Chronicles 30:13	And many people gathered together in Jerusalem, so that they could keep the solemnity of unleavened bread, in the second month.
2 Chronicles 30:14	And rising up, they destroyed the altars which were in Jerusalem, and all the things in which incense was burned to idols. Overturning these things, they cast them into the torrent Kidron.
2 Chronicles 30:15	Then they immolated the Passover on the fourteenth day of the second month. Also, the priests and Levites, at length having been sanctified, offered the holocausts in the house of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 30:16	And they stood in their order, according to the disposition and law of Moses, the man of God. Yet truly, the priests took up the blood, which was to be poured out, from the hands of the Levites,
2 Chronicles 30:17	because a great number were not sanctified. And therefore, the Levites immolated the Passover for those who had not been sanctified to the Lord in time.
2 Chronicles 30:18	And now a great portion of the people from Ephraim, and Manasseh, and Issachar, and Zebulun, who had not been sanctified, ate the Passover, which is not in accord with what was written. And Hezekiah prayed for them, saying: “The good Lord will be forgiving
2 Chronicles 30:19	to all who, with their whole heart, seek the Lord, the God of their fathers. And he will not impute it to them, though they have not been sanctified.”
2 Chronicles 30:20	And the Lord heeded him, and was reconciled to the people.
2 Chronicles 30:21	And the sons of Israel who were found at Jerusalem kept the solemnity of unleavened bread for seven days with great rejoicing, praising the Lord throughout each day, with the Levites and the priests, accompanied by the musical instruments corresponding to their office.
2 Chronicles 30:22	And Hezekiah spoke to the heart of all the Levites, who had a good understanding concerning the Lord. And they ate during the seven days of the solemnity, immolating victims of peace offerings, and praising the Lord, the God of their fathers.
2 Chronicles 30:23	And it pleased the entire multitude that they should celebrate, even for another seven days. And they did this with enormous gladness.
2 Chronicles 30:24	For Hezekiah, the king of Judah, had offered to the multitude one thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep. Truly, the rulers had given the people one thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep. Then a great mulititude of priests was sanctified.
2 Chronicles 30:25	And the whole multitude of Judah, as much the priests and Levites as the entire crowd that had arrived from Israel, and also the converts from the land of Israel, and those with a habitation in Judah, was overflowing with cheerfulness.
2 Chronicles 30:26	And there was a great celebration in Jerusalem, to such an extent as had not been in that city since the days of Solomon, the son of David, the king of Israel.
2 Chronicles 30:27	Then the priests and Levites rose up and blessed the people. And their voice was heeded. And their prayer reached the holy habitation of heaven.
2 Chronicles 31:1	And when these things had been celebrated according to ritual, all of Israel who had been found in the cities of Judah went forth, and they broke apart the idols and cut down the sacred groves. They demolished the high places and destroyed the altars, not only out of all Judah and Benjamin, but also out of Ephraim as well as Manasseh, until they utterly destroyed them. And all the sons of Israel returned to their possessions and cities.
2 Chronicles 31:2	Then Hezekiah appointed the companies of the priests and Levites by their divisions, each man in his proper office, certainly as much for the priests as for the Levites, for the sake of holocausts and peace offerings, so that they might minister and confess and sing, at the gates of the camp of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 31:3	Now the portion of the king, from his own substance, was such that they could offer a holocaust always, in morning and in evening, also on the Sabbaths, and the new moons, and the other solemnities, just as it was written in the law of Moses.
2 Chronicles 31:4	And now he instructed the people living in Jerusalem that they were to give portions to the priests and Levites, so that they would be able to attend to the law of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 31:5	And when this had reached the ears of the multitude, the sons of Israel brought an abundance of first-fruits of grain, wine, and oil, and also honey. And they offered a tenth part of all that the soil brings forth.
2 Chronicles 31:6	Then too, the sons of Israel and Judah, who were living in the cities of Judah, brought tithes of oxen and sheep, and tithes of the holy things that they had vowed to the Lord their God. And carrying all these things, they made many stacks.
2 Chronicles 31:7	In the third month, they began to lay out the foundations of the stacks. And in the seventh month, they finished them.
2 Chronicles 31:8	And when Hezekiah and his rulers had entered, they saw the stacks, and they blessed the Lord and the people of Israel.
2 Chronicles 31:9	And Hezekiah questioned the priests and Levites, as to why the stacks were laid out in this way.
2 Chronicles 31:10	Azariah, the high priest from the stock of Zadok, answered him, saying: “Since the first-fruits began to be offered in the house of the Lord, we have eaten and been satisfied, and much remains. For the Lord has blessed his people. Then what was left over is this great abundance, which you see.”
2 Chronicles 31:11	And so Hezekiah instructed that they should prepare storage places for the house of the Lord. And when they had done so,
2 Chronicles 31:12	they faithfully brought in the first-fruits, as well as the tithes and all that they had vowed. Now the overseer of these things was Conaniah, a Levite; and his brother, Shimei, was second.
2 Chronicles 31:13	And after him, there was Jehiel, and Azariah, and Nahath, and Asaahel, and Jerimoth, and also Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, who were overseers under the hands of Conaniah, and his brother, Shimei, by the authority of Hezekiah, the king, and Azariah, the high priest of the house of God, to whom all these things belonged.
2 Chronicles 31:14	Yet truly, Kore, the son of Imnah, a Levite and the porter of the eastern gate, was the overseer of the things that were being offered freely to the Lord, and of the first-fruits, and of the things consecrated for the Holy of Holies.
2 Chronicles 31:15	And under his charge were Eden, and Benjamin, Jeshua, and Shemaiah, and also Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, so that they would distribute faithfully to their brothers, the small as well as the great, their portions
2 Chronicles 31:16	(except for the males from three years old and upward) for all who were entering the temple of the Lord, and for whatever was needed for the ministry, throughout each day, as well as for the observances according to their divisions.
2 Chronicles 31:17	And so, for the priests, by their families, and for the Levites, from the twentieth year and upward, by their orders and companies,
2 Chronicles 31:18	and for the entire multitude, as much for the wives as for their children of both sexes, provisions were offered faithfully from whatever had been sanctified.
2 Chronicles 31:19	Then too, men were appointed of the sons of Aaron, throughout the fields and the suburbs of each city, who would distribute portions to all the males among the priests and Levites.
2 Chronicles 31:20	Therefore, Hezekiah did all these things (which we have said) in all of Judah. And he worked what is good and upright and true before the Lord his God,
2 Chronicles 31:21	for the whole service of the ministry of the house of the Lord, in accord with the law and the ceremonies, desiring to seek his God with his whole heart. And he did so, and he prospered.
2 Chronicles 32:1	After these things, and after this manner of truth, Sennacherib, the king of the Assyrians arrived. And entering Judah, he besieged the fortified cities, desiring to seize them.
2 Chronicles 32:2	And when Hezekiah had seen this, specifically that Sennacherib had arrived, and that the entire force of the war was turning against Jerusalem,
2 Chronicles 32:3	he took counsel with the rulers and with the most valiant men, so that they might obstruct the heads of the springs which were beyond the city. And with everyone discerning the same judgment about this,
2 Chronicles 32:4	he gathered together a great multitude, and they obstructed all the springs, and the brook which was flowing through the midst of the land, saying: “Otherwise, the kings of the Assyrians might arrive and find an abundance of water.”
2 Chronicles 32:5	Also, acting industriously, he built up the entire wall that had been broken apart. And he constructed towers upon it, and another wall outside it. And he repaired Millo, in the City of David. And he made all kinds of weapons and shields.
2 Chronicles 32:6	And he appointed leaders of the warriors within the army. And he summoned them all to the wide street of the gate of the city. And he spoke to their heart, saying:
2 Chronicles 32:7	“Act manfully and be strengthened. Do not be afraid. Neither should you dread the king of the Assyrians and the entire multitude that is with him. For many more are with us than with him.
2 Chronicles 32:8	For with him is an arm of flesh; with us is the Lord our God, who is our helper, and who fights for us.” And the people were strengthened by this type of words from Hezekiah, the king of Judah.
2 Chronicles 32:9	After these things, Sennacherib, the king of the Assyrians, sent his servants to Jerusalem, (for he and his entire army were besieging Lachish) to Hezekiah, the king of Judah, and to all the people who were in the city, saying:
2 Chronicles 32:10	“Thus says Sennacherib, the king of the Assyrians: In whom do you have faith, as you sit besieged in Jerusalem?
2 Chronicles 32:11	Does not Hezekiah deceive you, so that he would deliver you to die from hunger and thirst, by affirming that the Lord your God will free you from the hand of the king of the Assyrians?
2 Chronicles 32:12	Is this not the same Hezekiah who destroyed his own high places and altars, and who instructed Judah and Jerusalem, saying: ‘You shall worship before one altar, and you shall burn incense upon it?’
2 Chronicles 32:13	Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands? Have the gods of the nations and all the lands prevailed so as to free their region from my hand?
2 Chronicles 32:14	Who is there, out of all the gods of the nations that my fathers destroyed, who is able to rescue his people from my hand, so that now also your God would be able to rescue you from this hand?
2 Chronicles 32:15	Therefore, let not Hezekiah deceive or delude you with vain persuasion. And you should not believe him. For if no god out of all the nations and kingdoms was able to free his people from my hand, and from the hand of my fathers, consequently neither will your God be able to rescue you from my hand.”
2 Chronicles 32:16	Then too, his servants were speaking many other things against the Lord God, and against his servant Hezekiah.
2 Chronicles 32:17	Also, he wrote letters full of blasphemy against the Lord God of Israel. And against him he said: “Just as the gods of other nations were unable to free their people from my hand, so also is the God of Hezekiah unable to rescue his people from this hand.”
2 Chronicles 32:18	Moreover, he also shouted with a great clamor, in the language of the Jews, toward the people who were sitting upon the walls of Jerusalem, so that he might frighten them and so seize the city.
2 Chronicles 32:19	And he was speaking against the God of Jerusalem, just as against the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are works of the hands of men.
2 Chronicles 32:20	And Hezekiah the king, and Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, prayed against this blasphemy, and they cried out to heaven.
2 Chronicles 32:21	And the Lord sent an Angel, who struck all the experienced men and warriors, and the leaders of the army of the king of the Assyrians. And he returned in disgrace to his own land. And when he had entered the house of his god, the sons who had gone forth from his loins killed him with the sword.
2 Chronicles 32:22	And the Lord saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib, the king of the Assyrians, and from the hand of all. And he presented to them peace on every side.
2 Chronicles 32:23	And now many were bringing victims and sacrifices to the Lord in Jerusalem, and gifts to Hezekiah, the king of Judah. And after these things, he was exalted before all the nations.
2 Chronicles 32:24	In those days, Hezekiah was sick, even unto death, and he prayed to the Lord. And he heeded him, and gave to him a sign.
2 Chronicles 32:25	But he did not repay according to the benefits which he had received, for his heart was lifted up. And so wrath was brought against him, and against Judah and Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 32:26	And after this, he was humbled, because he had exalted his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And therefore the wrath of the Lord did not overwhelm them in the days of Hezekiah.
2 Chronicles 32:27	Now Hezekiah was wealthy and very famous. And he gathered for himself many treasures of silver and gold and precious stones, of aromatics, and all kinds of weapons, and vessels of great price,
2 Chronicles 32:28	and also repositories of grain, wine, and oil, and stalls for every beast of burden, and fencing for cattle.
2 Chronicles 32:29	And he built for himself cities. For indeed, he had innumerable herds and flocks of sheep. For the Lord had given to him an exceedingly great substance.
2 Chronicles 32:30	This same Hezekiah was the one who blocked the upper font of the waters of Gihon, and who diverted them down to the western part of the City of David. In all his works, he prosperously accomplished whatever he willed.
2 Chronicles 32:31	Yet still, concerning the legates from the leaders of Babylon, who had been sent to him so that they might inquire about the portent which had happened upon the earth, God permitted him to be tempted, so that everything might be made known which was in his heart.
2 Chronicles 32:32	Now the rest of the words of Hezekiah, and his mercies, have been written in the vision of the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amos, and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
2 Chronicles 32:33	And Hezekiah slept with his fathers. And they buried him above the sepulchers of the sons of David. And all of Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, celebrated his funeral. And his son, Manasseh, reigned in his place.
2 Chronicles 33:1	Manasseh was twelve years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for fifty-five years in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 33:2	But he did evil before the Lord, in accord with all the abominations of the nations which the Lord overturned before the sons of Israel.
2 Chronicles 33:3	And turning away, he repaired the high places, which had been demolished by his father, Hezekiah. And he constructed altars to the Baals, and made sacred groves. And he adored the entire army of heaven, and he served them.
2 Chronicles 33:4	Also, he built altars in the house of the Lord, about which the Lord had said, “My name shall be in Jerusalem forever.”
2 Chronicles 33:5	But he built these for the entire army of heaven, in the two courts of the house of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 33:6	And he caused his sons to pass through fire in the Valley of the son of Hinnom. He observed dreams, followed divinations, served the occult arts, had with him magicians and enchanters, and worked many evils before the Lord, so that he provoked him.
2 Chronicles 33:7	Also, he set up a graven image and molten statue in the house of God, about which God said to David, and to his son Solomon: “In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel, I will place my name forever.
2 Chronicles 33:8	And I will not cause the foot of Israel to be moved from the land which I delivered to their fathers. Yet this is so, only if they will take care to do what I have instructed them, by the hand of Moses, with the entire law and the ceremonies and the judgments.”
2 Chronicles 33:9	And so Manasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that they did evil, more so than all the nations which the Lord had overturned before the face of the sons of Israel.
2 Chronicles 33:10	And the Lord spoke to him and to his people, but they were not willing to pay attention.
2 Chronicles 33:11	Therefore, he led over them the leaders of the army of the king of the Assyrians. And they captured Manasseh, and they led him, bound with chains and fetters, to Babylon.
2 Chronicles 33:12	And after this, being in great anguish, he prayed to the Lord his God. And he did penance greatly before the God of his fathers.
2 Chronicles 33:13	And he petitioned and begged him intently. And he heeded his prayer, and led him back to Jerusalem, into his kingdom. And Manasseh realized that the Lord himself was God.
2 Chronicles 33:14	After these things, he built a wall outside the City of David, to the west of Gihon, at the steep valley, from the entrance to the fish gate, circling around as far as Ophel. And he raised it up greatly. And he appointed leaders of the army in all the fortified cities of Judah.
2 Chronicles 33:15	And he took away the foreign gods, and the idol from the house of the Lord, and also the altars which he had made on the mount of the house of the Lord and in Jerusalem. And he cast all these things outside the city.
2 Chronicles 33:16	Then he repaired the altar of the Lord, and he immolated upon it victims, and peace offerings, with praise. And he instructed Judah to serve the Lord, the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles 33:17	Yet still the people were immolating on the high places, to the Lord their God.
2 Chronicles 33:18	But the rest of the deeds of Manasseh, and his prayer to his God, and also the words of the seers who were speaking to him in the name of the Lord, the God of Israel, are contained in the words of the kings of Israel.
2 Chronicles 33:19	Also, his prayer and its heeding, and all his sins and contempt, and the sites on which he built high places and made sacred groves and statues, before he repented, have been written in the words of Hozai.
2 Chronicles 33:20	Then Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house. And his son, Amon, reigned in his place.
2 Chronicles 33:21	Amon was twenty-two years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for two years in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 33:22	And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, just as his father Manasseh had done. And he immolated to all the idols that Manasseh had fabricated, and he served them.
2 Chronicles 33:23	But he did not turn his face to the Lord, as his father Manasseh had turned himself. And he sinned much more grievously.
2 Chronicles 33:24	And when his servants had conspired against him, they killed him in his own house.
2 Chronicles 33:25	But the rest of the multitude of the people, having slain those who had struck down Amon, appointed his son, Josiah, as king in his place.
2 Chronicles 34:1	Josiah was eight years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for thirty-one years in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 34:2	And he did what was right in the sight of the Lord, and he walked in the ways of his father David. He did not turn away, neither to the right, nor to the left.
2 Chronicles 34:3	Now in the eighth year of his reign, when he was still a boy, he began to seek the God of his father David. And in the twelfth year after he had begun to reign, he cleansed Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the sacred groves, and the idols, and the graven images.
2 Chronicles 34:4	And in his sight, they destroyed the altars of the Baals, and they demolished the idols which had been set upon them. And then he cut down the sacred groves and crushed the graven images. And he scattered the fragments upon the tombs of those who had been accustomed to immolate to them.
2 Chronicles 34:5	And after that, he burned the bones of the priests upon the altars of the idols. And so did he cleanse Judah and Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 34:6	Then too, in the cities of Manasseh, and of Ephraim, and of Simeon, even to Naphtali, he overturned everything.
2 Chronicles 34:7	And when he had destroyed the altars and the sacred groves, and had broken the idols to pieces, and when all the profane shrines had been demolished from the entire land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 34:8	And so, in the eighteenth year of his reign, having now cleansed the land and the temple of the Lord, he sent Shaphan, the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah, the ruler of the city, and Joah, the son of Joahaz, the historian, to repair the house of the Lord his God.
2 Chronicles 34:9	And they went to Hilkiah, the high priest. And having accepted from him the money which had been brought into the house of the Lord, and which the Levites and porters had gathered together from Manasseh, and Ephraim, and the entire remnant of Israel, and also from all of Judah, and Benjamin, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
2 Chronicles 34:10	they delivered it into the hands of those who were in charge of the workers in the house of the Lord, so that they might repair the temple, and restore whatever was weak.
2 Chronicles 34:11	And they gave it to the artisans and the stoneworkers, so that they might buy stones from the quarries, and wood for the joints of the building and for the upper floors the houses, which the kings of Judah had destroyed.
2 Chronicles 34:12	And they did everything faithfully. Now the overseers of the workers were Jahath and Obadiah, from the sons of Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam, from the sons of Kohath, who were supervising the work. All were Levites who knew how to play musical instruments.
2 Chronicles 34:13	Truly, scribes and teachers, from among the Levites who were porters, were over those who were carrying burdens for various uses.
2 Chronicles 34:14	And when they carried out the money that had been brought into the temple of the Lord, Hilkiah the priest found the book of the law of the Lord by the hand of Moses.
2 Chronicles 34:15	And he said to Shaphan, the scribe: “I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord.” And he delivered it to him.
2 Chronicles 34:16	Then he took the volume to the king, and he reported to him, saying: “Behold, everything that you entrusted to your servants is completed.
2 Chronicles 34:17	They have melted together the silver that was found in the house of the Lord. And it has been given to the overseers of the artisans and craftsmen for various works.
2 Chronicles 34:18	After this, Hilkiah the priest gave to me this book.” And when he had read it in the presence of the king,
2 Chronicles 34:19	and he had heard the words of the law, he tore his garments.
2 Chronicles 34:20	And he instructed Hilkiah, and Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, and Abdon, the son of Micah, and also Shaphan, the scribe, and Asaiah, the servant of the king, saying:
2 Chronicles 34:21	“Go, and pray to the Lord for me, and for the remnant of Israel and Judah, concerning all the words of this book, which has been found. For the great fury of the Lord has rained down upon us, because our fathers did not keep the words of the Lord, to do all that has been written in this volume.”
2 Chronicles 34:22	Therefore, Hilkiah, and those who had been sent with him by the king, went to Huldah, the prophetess, the wife of Shallum, the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, the keeper of the vestments. She was living in Jerusalem, in the second part. And they spoke to her the words which we explained above.
2 Chronicles 34:23	And she responded to them: “Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Tell the man who sent you to me:
2 Chronicles 34:24	Thus says the Lord: Behold, I will lead in evils over this place, and over its inhabitants, with all the curses that have been written in this book, which they have read before the king of Judah.
2 Chronicles 34:25	For they have abandoned me, and they have sacrificed to foreign gods, so that they provoked me to wrath by all the works of their hands. Therefore, my fury will rain down upon this place, and it will not be extinguished.
2 Chronicles 34:26	To the king of Judah, who sent you to petition before the Lord, so shall you speak: Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Since you listened to the words of this volume,
2 Chronicles 34:27	and your heart was softened, and you humbled yourself in the sight of God concerning these things which have been said against this place and against the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and since, revering my face, you have torn your garments, and have wept before me: I also have heeded you, says the Lord.
2 Chronicles 34:28	For now I will gather you to your fathers, and you will be brought into your sepulcher in peace. Neither shall your eyes see all the evil that I will lead in, over this place and over its inhabitants.” And so they took back to the king all that she had said.
2 Chronicles 34:29	And he, calling together all those greater by birth of Judah and Jerusalem,
2 Chronicles 34:30	ascended to the house of the Lord, united with all the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the priests and the Levites, and all the people, from the least even to the greatest. And in their hearing, in the house of the Lord, the king read all the words of the volume.
2 Chronicles 34:31	And standing up at his tribunal, he struck a covenant before the Lord, so that he would walk after him, and would keep his precepts and testimonies and justifications, with his whole heart and with his whole soul, and so that he would do the things that were written in that volume, which he had read.
2 Chronicles 34:32	Also, concerning this, he bound by oath all who had been found in Jerusalem and Benjamin. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem acted in accord with the covenant of the Lord, the God of their fathers.
2 Chronicles 34:33	Therefore, Josiah took away all the abominations from all the regions of the sons of Israel. And he caused all who were remaining in Israel to serve the Lord their God. During all his days, they did not withdraw from the Lord, the God of their fathers.
2 Chronicles 35:1	Now Josiah kept the Passover to the Lord in Jerusalem, and it was immolated on the fourteenth day of the first month.
2 Chronicles 35:2	And he appointed the priests in their offices, and he exhorted them to minister in the house of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 35:3	Also, he spoke with the Levites, by whose instruction all of Israel was sanctified to the Lord, saying: “Place the ark in the sanctuary of the temple, which Solomon, the son of David, the king of Israel, built. For never again shall you carry it. Instead, now you shall minister to the Lord your God, and to his people Israel.
2 Chronicles 35:4	And prepare yourselves by your houses and families, within each division, just as David, the king of Israel, instructed, and just as his son Solomon has written.
2 Chronicles 35:5	And minister in the sanctuary, by the Levitical families and companies.
2 Chronicles 35:6	And having been sanctified, immolate the Passover. And then prepare your brothers, so that they may be able to act in accord with the words which the Lord has spoken by the hand of Moses.”
2 Chronicles 35:7	After this, Josiah gave to all the people, those who had been found there at the solemnity of the Passover, thirty thousand lambs and young goats from the flocks, and other kinds of small cattle, and also three thousand oxen. All these were from the substance of the king.
2 Chronicles 35:8	Also, his rulers offered what they had vowed freely, as much for the people as for the priests and Levites. Moreover, Hilkiah, and Zechariah, and Jehiel, rulers of the house of the Lord, gave to the priests, in order to observe the Passover, two thousand six hundred small cattle, and three hundred oxen.
2 Chronicles 35:9	And Conaniah, with Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brothers, indeed also Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, rulers of the Levites, gave to the rest of the Levites, in order to celebrate the Passover, five thousand small cattle, and five hundred oxen.
2 Chronicles 35:10	And the ministry was prepared. And the priests stood in their office, and the Levites also stood in their companies, according to the order of the king.
2 Chronicles 35:11	And the Passover was immolated. And the priests sprinkled the blood with their hand, and the Levites drew away the pelts of the holocausts.
2 Chronicles 35:12	And they put these aside, so that they might give them to each one, by their houses and families, and so that they might be offered to the Lord, just as it was written in the book of Moses. And with the oxen, they acted similarly.
2 Chronicles 35:13	And they roasted the Passover above fire, in accord with what was written in the law. Yet truly, the victims of peace offerings they boiled in cauldrons and kettles and pots. And they promptly distributed these to all the common people.
2 Chronicles 35:14	Then afterward, they made preparations for themselves and for the priests. Indeed, the priests had been occupied in the oblations of the holocausts and the fat offerings, even until night. Therefore, the Levites made preparations for themselves and for the priests, the sons of Aaron, last.
2 Chronicles 35:15	Now the singers, the sons of Asaph, were standing in their order, according to the instruction of David, and of Asaph and Heman and Jeduthun, the prophets of the king. Truly, the porters kept watch at each gate, so as not to depart from their ministry even for one moment. And for this reason, their brothers, the Levites, prepared foods for them.
2 Chronicles 35:16	And so, the entire worship ritual of the Lord was completed on that day, so that they observed the Passover and offered holocausts upon the altar of the Lord, in accord with the precept of king Josiah.
2 Chronicles 35:17	And the sons of Israel, who had been found there, kept the Passover at that time, with the solemnity of unleavened bread, for seven days.
2 Chronicles 35:18	There was no Passover similar to this one in Israel, from the days of Samuel the prophet. And neither did anyone, out of all the kings of Israel, keep such a Passover as did Josiah, the priests and Levites, and all those of Judah and Israel who had been found, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 35:19	In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah, this Passover was celebrated.
2 Chronicles 35:20	After Josiah had repaired the temple, Neco, the king of Egypt, ascended to fight at Carchemish, beside the Euphrates. And Josiah went out to meet him.
2 Chronicles 35:21	But he sent messengers to him, saying: “What is there between me and you, O king of Judah? I have not come against you today. Instead, I am fighting against another house, to which God instructed me to go promptly. Refrain from acting against God, who is with me, otherwise he may kill you.”
2 Chronicles 35:22	Josiah was not willing to return. Instead, he prepared for war against him. Neither would he agree to the words of Neco from the mouth of God. In truth, he traveled so that he might do battle in the field of Megiddo.
2 Chronicles 35:23	And there, having been wounded by archers, he said to his servants: “Lead me away from the battle. For I have been severely wounded.”
2 Chronicles 35:24	And they took him from the chariot, into another chariot which was following him, as was the custom of kings. And they transported him to Jerusalem. And he died, and he was buried in the mausoleum of his fathers. And all of Judah and Jerusalem mourned for him,
2 Chronicles 35:25	most of all Jeremiah. All the singing men and women repeat his lamentations over Josiah, even to the present day. And this has become like a law in Israel. Behold, it is found written in the Lamentations.
2 Chronicles 35:26	Now the rest of the words of Josiah, and his mercies, which were instructed by the law of the Lord,
2 Chronicles 35:27	and also his works, the first and the last, have been written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
2 Chronicles 36:1	Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz, the son of Josiah, and they appointed him king in place of his father, in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 36:2	Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for three months in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 36:3	Then the king of Egypt, when he had arrived in Jerusalem, removed him, and condemned the land to one hundred talents of silver and one talent of gold.
2 Chronicles 36:4	And he appointed Eliakim, his brother, as king in his place, over Judah and Jerusalem. And he changed his name to Jehoiakim. Truly, he took Jehoahaz with him, and he led him away to Egypt.
2 Chronicles 36:5	Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for eleven years in Jerusalem. And he did evil before the Lord his God.
2 Chronicles 36:6	Nebuchadnezzar, the king of the Chaldeans, ascended against him, and led him bound in chains to Babylon.
2 Chronicles 36:7	And to there, he also took away the vessels of the Lord, and he placed them in his temple.
2 Chronicles 36:8	But the rest of the words of Jehoiakim, and his abominations that he worked, and the things that were found in him, are contained in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. Then his son, Jehoiachin, reigned in his place.
2 Chronicles 36:9	Jehoiachin was eight years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for three months and ten days in Jerusalem. And he did evil in the sight of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 36:10	And when the course of a year had turned, king Nebuchadnezzar sent and brought him to Babylon, carrying away, at the same time, the most precious vessels of the house of the Lord. Truly, he appointed his uncle, Zedekiah, as king over Judah and Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 36:11	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he had begun to reign. And he reigned for eleven years in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 36:12	And he did evil in the eyes of the Lord his God. And he did not show remorse before the face of the prophet Jeremiah, who was speaking to him from the mouth of the Lord.
2 Chronicles 36:13	Also, he withdrew from king Nebuchadnezzar, who had bound him by an oath to God, and he hardened his own neck and his own heart, so that he did not return to the Lord, the God of Israel.
2 Chronicles 36:14	Then too, all the leaders of the priests, with the people, transgressed iniquitously, in accord with all the abominations of the Gentiles. And they polluted the house of the Lord, which he had sanctified to himself in Jerusalem.
2 Chronicles 36:15	Then the Lord, the God of their fathers, sent to them, by the hand of his messengers, rising in the night and daily admonishing them. For he was lenient to his people and to his habitation.
2 Chronicles 36:16	But they ridiculed the messengers of God, and they gave little weight to his words, and they mocked the prophets, until the fury of the Lord ascended against his people, and there was no remedy.
2 Chronicles 36:17	For he led over them the king of the Chaldeans. And he put to death their young men by the sword, in the house of his sanctuary. There was no pity for adolescents, nor virgins, nor the elderly, nor even for the disabled. Instead, he delivered them all into his hands.
2 Chronicles 36:18	And all the vessels of the house of Lord, as much the greater as the lesser, and the treasures of the temple, and of the king and the rulers, he carried away to Babylon.
2 Chronicles 36:19	The enemies set fire to the house of God, and they destroyed the wall of Jerusalem. They burned down all the towers. And whatever was precious, they demolished.
2 Chronicles 36:20	If anyone had escaped from the sword, he was led into Babylon. And he served the king and his sons, until the king of Persia would command,
2 Chronicles 36:21	and the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah would be fulfilled, and the land would celebrate her Sabbaths. For during all the days of the desolation, she kept a Sabbath, until the seventy years were completed.
2 Chronicles 36:22	Then, in the first year of Cyrus, the king of the Persians, in order to fulfill the word of the Lord, which he had spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah, the Lord stirred up the heart of Cyrus, the king of the Persians, who commanded this to be proclaimed throughout his entire kingdom, and also in writing, saying:
2 Chronicles 36:23	“Thus says Cyrus, the king of the Persians: The Lord, the God of heaven, has given to me all the kingdoms of the earth. And he has instructed me that I should build for him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judea. Who among you is from his entire people? May the Lord his God be with him, and let him ascend.”

Paul, a servant of God and an Apostle of Jesus Christ, in accord with the faith of God’s elect and in acknowledgment of the truth which is accompanied by piety,
in the hope of the eternal life that God, who does not lie, promised before the ages of time,
which, at the proper time, he has manifested by his Word, in the preaching that has been entrusted to me by the command of God our Savior;
to Titus, beloved son according to the common faith. Grace and peace, from God the Father and from Christ Jesus our Savior.
For this reason, I left you behind in Crete: so that those things which are lacking, you would correct, and so that you would ordain, throughout the communities, priests, (just as I also ordained you)
if such a man is without offense, the husband of one wife, having faithful children, not accused of self-indulgence, nor of insubordination.
And a bishop, as a steward of God, must be without offense: not arrogant, not short-tempered, not a drunkard, not violent, not desiring tainted profit,
but instead: hospitable, kind, sober, just, holy, chaste,
embracing faithful speech which is in agreement with doctrine, so that he may be able to exhort in sound doctrine and to argue against those who contradict.
For there are, indeed, many who are disobedient, who speak empty words, and who deceive, especially those who are of the circumcision.
These must be reproved, for they subvert entire houses, teaching things which should not be taught, for the favor of shameful gain.
A certain one of these, a prophet of their own kind, said: “The Cretans are ever liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.”
This testimony is true. Because of this, rebuke them sharply, so that they may be sound in the faith,
not paying attention to Jewish fables, nor to the rules of men who have turned themselves away from the truth.
All things are clean to those who are clean. But to those who are defiled, and to unbelievers, nothing is clean; for both their mind and their conscience have been polluted.
They claim that they know God. But, by their own works, they deny him, since they are abominable, and unbelieving, and reprobate, toward every good work.
But you are to speak the things that befit sound doctrine.
Old men should be sober, chaste, prudent, sound in faith, in love, in patience.
Old women, similarly, should be in holy attire, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teaching well,
so that they may teach prudence to the young women, so that they may love their husbands, love their children,
be sensible, chaste, restrained, have concern for the household, be kind, be subordinate to their husbands: so that the Word of God may be not blasphemed.
Exhort young men similarly, so that they may show self-restraint.
In all things, present yourself as an example of good works: in doctrine, with integrity, with seriousness,
with sound words, irreproachably, so that he who is an opponent may dread that he has nothing evil to say about us.
Exhort servants to be submissive to their masters, in all things pleasing, not contradicting,
not cheating, but in all things showing good fidelity, so that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things.
For the grace of God our Savior has appeared to all men,
instructing us to reject impiety and worldly desires, so that we may live soberly and justly and piously in this age,
looking forward to the blessed hope and the advent of the glory of the great God and of our Savior Jesus Christ.
He gave himself for our sake, so that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and might cleanse for himself an acceptable people, pursuers of good works.
Speak and exhort and argue these things with all authority. Let no one despise you.
Admonish them to be subordinate to the rulers and authorities, to obey their dictates, to be prepared for every good work,
to speak evil of no one, not to be litigious, but to be reserved, displaying all meekness toward all men.
For, in times past, we ourselves were also unwise, unbelieving, erring, servants of various desires and pleasures, acting with malice and envy, being hateful and hating one another.
But then the kindness and humanity of God our Savior appeared.
And he saved us, not by works of justice that we had done, but, in accord with his mercy, by the washing of regeneration and by the renovation of the Holy Spirit,
whom he has poured out upon us in abundance, through Jesus Christ our Savior,
so that, having been justified by his grace, we may become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
This is a faithful saying. And I want you to confirm these things, so that those who believe in God may take care to excel in good works. These things are good and useful to men.
But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, as well as arguments against the law. For these are useless and empty.
Avoid a man who is a heretic, after the first and second correction,
knowing that one who is like this has been subverted, and that he offends; for he has been condemned by his own judgment.
When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, hurry to return to me at Nicopolis. For I have decided to winter there.
Send Zenas the lawyer and Apollo ahead with care, and let nothing be lacking to them.
But let our men also learn to excel in good works pertaining to the necessities of life, so that they may not be unfruitful.
All those who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in the faith. May the grace of God be with you all. Amen.

In the eighth month, in the second year of king Darius, the word of the Lord came to Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying:
The Lord has become angry over the resentful anger of your fathers.
And you shall say to them: Thus says the Lord of hosts: Turn to me, says the Lord of hosts, and I will turn to you, says the Lord of hosts.
Do not be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets cried out, saying: Thus says the Lord of hosts: Turn from your evil ways and from your wicked thoughts. But they did not heed, and neither did they pay attention to me, says the Lord.
Your fathers, where are they? And will the prophets live unceasingly?
Yet truly my words and my lawfulness, which I entrusted to my servants the prophets, were indeed comprehended by your fathers, and so they were converted, and they said: Just as the Lord of hosts decided to do to us, according to our ways and according to our inventions, so has he done to us.
On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is called Shevat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying:
I saw by night, and behold, a man riding on a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees, which were in the chasm. And behind him were horses: red, speckled, and white.
And I said, “What are these, my lord?” And the angel, who was speaking with me, said to me, “I will reveal to you what these are.”
And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, “These are they, whom the Lord has sent in order to walk through the earth.”
And those who stood among the myrtle trees answered the angel of the Lord, and they said, “We have walked through the earth, and behold, all the earth is inhabited and is at rest.”
And the angel of the Lord answered and said, “Lord of hosts, how long will you not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, with which you have been angry? This is now the seventieth year.”
And the Lord answered the angel, who had been speaking with me, good words, consoling words.
And the angel, who was speaking with me, said to me: Cry out, saying: Thus says the Lord of hosts: I have been zealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great zeal.
And, with a great anger, I am angry with the wealthy nations. Though I had been angry a little, truly they advanced further in evil.
Because of this, thus says the Lord: I will be turned back, towards Jerusalem, with mercies; and my house will be built upon this, says the Lord of hosts. And the building line will be extended over Jerusalem.
Until then, cry out saying: Thus says the Lord of hosts: Until then, my cities will flow with good things, and, until then, the Lord will comfort Zion, and, until then, he will single out Jerusalem.
And I lifted up my eyes, and I saw. And behold: four horns.
And I said to the angel, who was speaking with me, “What are these?” And he said to me, “These are the horns that have winnowed Judah and Israel and Jerusalem.”
And the Lord showed me four workmen.
And I said, “What have these come to do?” He spoke, saying, “These are the horns that have winnowed Judah, through every single man, and none of them lifted up his head. And these have come to frighten them away, so as to cast down the horns of the Gentiles, which have lifted up a horn over the land of Judah, so as to scatter it.”
And I lifted up my eyes, and I saw, and behold, a man, and in his hand was a measuring line.
And I said, “Where are you going?” And he said to me, “To measure Jerusalem, so that I may see how great its width and how great its length may be.”
And behold, the angel, who had been speaking with me, departed, and another angel went out to meet him.
And he said to him: Hurry, speak to this young man, saying: Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls, because of the multitude of men and beasts of burden in its midst.
And I will be to it, says the Lord, a wall of fire all around. And in glory, I will be in its midst.
O, O flee from the land of the North, says the Lord, for I have scattered you into the four winds of heaven, says the Lord.
O Zion, flee, you who dwell with the daughter of Babylon.
For thus says the Lord of hosts: After the glory, he has sent me to the Gentiles, which have despoiled you. For he who touches you, touches the pupil of my eye.
For behold, I lift up my hand over them, and they will be a prey to those who had served them. And you will know that the Lord of hosts has sent me.
Sing praise and rejoice, daughter of Zion. For behold, I approach, and I will dwell in your midst, says the Lord.
And many nations will be joined to the Lord in that day, and they will be my people, and I will dwell in your midst. And you will know that the Lord of hosts has sent me to you.
And the Lord will possess his portion, Judah, in the sanctified land, and still he will single out Jerusalem.
Let all flesh be silent before the face of the Lord: for he has arisen from his holy dwelling place.
And the Lord revealed to me: Jesus the high priest, standing in the sight of the angel of the Lord. And Satan stood before his right hand, so as to be his adversary.
And the Lord said to Satan, “May the Lord rebuke you, Satan! And may the Lord, who chose Jerusalem, rebuke you! Are you not a firebrand plucked from the fire?”
And Jesus was clothed with filthy garments. And he stood before the face of an angel.
He answered and spoke to those who stood before him, saying, “Take away the filthy garments from him.” And he said to him, “Behold, I have taken away from you your iniquity, and I have clothed you with a change of clothing.”
And he said, “Place a clean diadem on his head.” And they placed a clean diadem on his head, and they clothed him with garments. And the angel of the Lord remained standing.
And the angel of the Lord contested with Jesus, saying:
Thus says the Lord of hosts: If you will walk in my ways and keep my charge, you likewise will judge my house and will keep my courts, and I will give you some of those who now attend here to walk with you.
Listen, Jesus the high priest, you and your friends, who dwell before you, who have been portending to men. For behold, I will lead my servant to the East.
For behold, the stone that I have bestowed before Jesus. Upon one stone, there are seven eyes. Behold, I will carve its engraving, says the Lord of hosts. And I will take away the iniquity of that land in one day.
On that day, says the Lord of hosts, every man will call his friend from under the vine and from under the fig tree.
And the angel who had been speaking with me returned, and he awakened me, like a man who is awakened from his sleep.
And he said to me, “What do you see?” And I said, “I looked, and behold, a candlestick entirely in gold, and its lamp was at its top, and seven oil lamps of it were upon it, and there were seven funnels for the oil lamps that were at its top.
And there were two olive trees upon it: one to the right of the lamp, and one to its left.”
And I answered and spoke to the angel who was speaking with me, saying, “What are these, my lord?”
And the angel who was speaking with me answered, and he said to me, “Do you not know what these are?” And I said, “No, my lord.”
And he answered and spoke to me, saying: This is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel, saying: Not by an army, nor by might, but in my spirit, says the Lord of hosts.
What are you, great mountain, in the sight of Zerubbabel? You are among the plains. And he will lead out the primary stone, and he will give equal grace to its grace.
And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
The hand of Zerubbabel has founded this house, and his hands will complete it. And you will know that the Lord of hosts has sent me to you.
For who has despised the little days? And they will rejoice and will see the silver and lead stone in the hand of Zerubbabel. These are the seven eyes of the Lord, which roam quickly through all the earth.
And I responded and said to him, “What are these two olive trees to the right of the candlestick, and to its left?”
And I responded a second time and said to him, “What are the two olive branches, which are next to the two golden ridges, in which are the pouring spouts of gold?”
And he spoke to me, saying, “Do you not know what these are?” And I said, “No, my lord.”
And he said, “These are the two sons of oil, who attend before the Sovereign of all the earth.”
And I turned and lifted up my eyes. And I saw, and behold, a book flying.
And he said to me, “What do you see?” And I said, “I see a book flying. Its length is twenty cubits, and its width is ten cubits.”
And he said to me, “This is the curse that goes forth over the face of the whole earth. For every thief will be judged, just as it has been written there, and everyone who swears by this, will be judged in like manner.”
I will bring it forth, says the Lord of hosts, and it will approach to the house of the thief, and to the house of him who swears falsely by my name, and it will remain in the midst of his house and will consume it, with its wood and its stones.
And the angel had departed, who was speaking with me. And he said to me, “Lift up your eyes, and see what this is, that goes forth.”
And I said, “What, then, is it?” And he said, “This is a container going forth.” And he said, “This is their eye in all the earth.”
And behold, a talent of lead was being carried; and behold, one woman sitting in the middle of the container.
And he said, “This is impiety.” And he cast her into the middle of the container, and he sent the weight of lead into its mouth.
And I lifted up my eyes and I saw. And behold, two women were departing, and a spirit was in their wings, and they had wings like the wings of a kite, and they lifted up the container between earth and heaven.
And I said to the angel who was speaking with me, “Where are they taking the container?”
And he said to me, “To a house that may be built for it in the land of Shinar, and so that it may be established and set there upon its own base.”
And I turned, and I lifted up my eyes and I saw. And behold, four four-horse chariots went out from the middle of two mountains. And the mountains were mountains of brass.
In the first chariot were red horses, and in the second chariot were black horses,
and in the third chariot were white horses, and in the fourth chariot were speckled horses, and they were strong.
And I responded and said to the angel who was speaking with me, “What are these, my lord?”
And the angel answered and said to me, “These are the four winds of heaven, which go forth to stand in the presence of the Sovereign of all the earth.”
The one with the black horses was departing into the land of the North, and the white went forth after them, and the speckled went forth towards the land of the South.
Yet those who were the most strong, went out, and sought to go and to roam quickly through all the earth. And he said, “Go, walk throughout the earth.” And they walked throughout the earth.
And he called me and spoke with me, saying, “Behold, those who go forth to the land of the North, have quieted my spirit in the land of the North.”
And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
From those of the captivity, take from Heldai, and from Tobijah, and from Jedaiah. You will approach in that day, and you will go into the house of Josiah, the son of Zephaniah, who came from Babylon.
And you will take gold and silver; and you will make crowns, and you will set them on the head of Jesus the son of Jehozadak, the high priest.
And you will speak to him, saying: Thus says the Lord of hosts, saying: Behold, a man; the Rising is his name. And under him, he will rise up, and he will build a temple to the Lord.
And he will raise a temple to the Lord. And he will carry the glory, and he will sit and rule upon his throne. And he will be a priest upon his throne, and a counsel of peace will be between the two of them.
And the crowns will be to Heldai, and Tobijah, and Jedaiah, as well as to Hem, the son of Zephaniah, as a memorial in the temple of the Lord.
And those who are far away, will approach, and will build in the temple of the Lord. And you will know that the Lord of hosts sent me to you. Yet this shall be only if, when hearing, you will have heeded the voice of the Lord your God.
And it happened, in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word of the Lord came to Zechariah, on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Kislev.
And Sharezer and Regemmelech, and the men who were with them, sent to the house of God, to entreat the face of the Lord,
to speak to the priests of the house of the Lord of hosts and to the prophets, saying: “Must there be weeping with me in the fifth month, and must I sanctify myself, as I have now done for many years?”
And the word of the Lord of hosts came to me, saying:
Speak to all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying: Although you may have fasted and mourned in the fifth and the seventh month for these seventy years, did you indeed keep a fast unto me?
And when you did eat and drink, did you not eat for yourselves, and drink only for yourselves?
Are not these the words that the Lord has spoken by the hand of the former prophets, when Jerusalem was still inhabited, so that it would prosper, itself and the cities around it, and those inhabitants towards the South and in the plains?
And the word of the Lord came to Zechariah, saying:
Thus says the Lord of hosts, saying: Judge with true judgment, and act with mercy and compassion, each and every one with his brother.
And do not find fault with the widow, and the orphan, and the newcomer, and the poor. And let not a man consider evil in his heart towards his brother.
But they were not willing to pay attention, and they turned aside their shoulder to depart, and they pressed upon their ears, so that they would not hear.
And they set their heart like the hardest stone, so that they would not hear the law and the words that the Lord of hosts has sent with his Spirit by the hand of the former prophets. And so a great indignation came from Lord of hosts.
And it happened, just as he had spoken, and they did not pay attention. So then, they shall cry out, and I will not heed, says the Lord of hosts.
And I dispersed them throughout all the kingdoms that they did not know. And the land was left desolate behind them, so that no one was passing through or returning. And they made the desirable land into a deserted place.
And the word of the Lord of hosts came, saying:
Thus says the Lord of hosts: I have been zealous for Zion with a great zeal, and with a great indignation have I been zealous for her.
Thus says the Lord of hosts: I have been turned back towards Zion, and I will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. And Jerusalem will be called: “The City of Truth,” and “The Mountain of the Lord of Hosts, the Sanctified Mountain.”
Thus says the Lord of hosts: Then elderly men and elderly women will dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man will be with his walking stick in his hand, because of the multitude of days.
And the streets of the city will be filled with toddlers and children, playing in its streets.
Thus says the Lord of hosts: If it seems difficult in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days, could it indeed be difficult in my eyes, says the Lord of hosts?
Thus says the Lord of hosts: Behold, I will save my people from the land of the East, and from the land of the setting of the sun.
And I will lead them, and they will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. And they will be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in justice.
Thus says the Lord of hosts: Let your hands be strengthened, you who, in those days, are listening to these words by the mouth of the prophets, in the day that the house of the Lord of hosts has been founded, so that the temple may be built.
Indeed, before those days, there was no pay for men, nor was there pay for beasts of burden, and neither was there peace for those entering, nor for those exiting, because of the tribulation. And I had dismissed all men, each one against his neighbor.
But now, I will not act towards the remnant of this people according to the former days, says the Lord of hosts.
But there will be a seed of peace: the vine will give her fruit, and the earth will give her seedlings, and the heavens will give their dew. And I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things.
And this shall be: just as you were a curse among the Gentiles, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I save you, and you will be a blessing. Do not be afraid. Let your hands be strengthened.
For thus says the Lord of hosts: Just as I intended to afflict you, when your fathers had provoked me to wrath, says the Lord,
and I did not show mercy, so have I turned back, thinking in these days to do good to the house of Judah and to Jerusalem. Do not be afraid.
Therefore, these are the words that you shall do: Speak the truth, each one to his neighbor. With truth and a judgment of peace, judge at your gates.
And let not anyone think up evil against his friend in your hearts. And do not choose to swear falsely. For all these are things that I hate, says the Lord.
And the word of the Lord of hosts came to me, saying:
Thus says the Lord of hosts: The fast of the fourth, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth will be for the house of Judah in joy and gladness and with bright solemnities. So then, love truth and peace.
Thus says the Lord of hosts, then the people may arrive and dwell in many cities,
and the inhabitants may hurry, one saying to another: “Let us go and entreat the face of the Lord, and let us seek the Lord of hosts. I will go also.”
And many peoples and strong nations will approach, seeking the Lord of hosts in Jerusalem, and to entreat the face of the Lord.
Thus says the Lord of hosts: In those days, then, ten men from every language of the Gentiles will grasp and cling to the hem of one man of Judea, saying: “We will go with you. For we have heard that God is with you.”
The burden of the word of the Lord in the land of Hadrach and its respite in Damascus. For the eye of man and of all the tribes of Israel is of the Lord.
Hamath also is at its limits, and Tyre and Sidon. For, of course, they have assumed themselves to be exceedingly wise.
And Tyre has built herself a fortress, and she has piled together silver, as if it were soil, and gold, as if it were the mud of the streets.
Behold, the Lord will possess her, and he will strike her strength in the sea, and she will be devoured by fire.
Ashkelon will see and be afraid. Both Gaza and he will be very sorrowful, as well as Ekron, because her hope has been confounded. And the king will pass away from Gaza, and Ashkelon will not be inhabited.
And the divider will sit in Ashdod, and I will scatter the arrogance of the Philistines.
And I will take away his blood from his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth, and yet he will be left for our God, and he will be like a governor in Judah, and Ekron will be like a Jebusite.
And I will encircle my house with those who serve me in war, going and returning, and the exactor will no longer pass over them. For now I have seen with my eyes.
Rejoice well, daughter of Zion, shout for joy, daughter of Jerusalem. Behold, your King will come to you: the Just One, the Savior. He is poor and riding upon a donkey, and upon a colt, the son of a donkey.
And I will scatter the four-horse chariot out of Ephraim and the horse from Jerusalem, and the bow of war will be destroyed. And he will speak peace to the Gentiles, and his power will be from sea to sea, and from the rivers even to the end of the earth.
You, likewise, by the blood of your testimony, have sent forth your prisoners from the pit, in which there is no water.
Turn back to the fortress, prisoners of hope. Today, I also announce that I will repay you double,
because I have stretched out Judah for myself, like a bow; I have filled Ephraim. And I will raise up your sons, Zion, above your sons, Greece. And I will set you as the sword of the strength.
And the Lord God will be seen over them, and his arrow will go forth like lightning. And the Lord God will sound the trumpet, and he will go forth into the whirlwind of the South.
The Lord of hosts will protect them. And they will devour and subdue with the stones of the sling. And, when drinking, they will become inebriated, as if with wine, and they will be filled like bowls and like the horns of the altar.
And in that day, the Lord their God will save them as the flock of his people. For holy stones will be lifted up over his land.
For what is his goodness and what is his beauty, other than grain among the elect and wine springing forth virgins?
Petition before the Lord for rain in the latter time, and the Lord will produce snows and will give showers of rain to them, to each blade in the field.
For the images have been speaking what is useless, and the diviners have seen a lie, and the dreamers have been speaking false hope: they have comforted in vain. For this reason, they have been led away like a flock; they will be afflicted, because they have no shepherd.
My fury has been kindled over the shepherds, and I will visit upon the he-goats. For the Lord of hosts has visited his flock, the house of Judah, and he has set them like the horse of his glory in the war.
From him will go forth the angle, from him the wooden peg, from him the bow of battle, from him every exactor at the same time.
And they will be like the strong, trampling the mud of the ways in battle. And they will fight, for the Lord is with them. And the riders of the horses will be confounded.
And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will convert them, because I will have mercy on them. And they will be as they were when I had not cast them away. For I am the Lord their God, and I will hear them.
And they will be like the strong of Ephraim, and their heart will rejoice as if by wine, and their sons will see and will rejoice, and their heart will exult in the Lord.
I will whistle for them, and I will gather them together, because I have redeemed them. And I will multiply them, as they had been multiplied before.
And I will sow them among the peoples, and from far away they will remember me. And they will live with their sons, and they will return.
And I will lead them back from the land of Egypt, and I will gather them from among the Assyrians, and I will lead them to the land of Gilead and Lebanon, and no place will be left that has not been found by them.
And he will pass over the narrow passage of the sea, and he will strike the waves of the sea, and all the depths of the river will be confounded, and the arrogance of Assyria will be brought low, and the scepter of Egypt will withdraw.
I will strengthen them in the Lord, and they will walk in his name, says the Lord.
Open your gates, Lebanon, and let fire consume your cedars.
Howl, you fir tree, for the cedar has fallen, because the magnificent have been devastated. Howl, you oaks of Bashan, because the secure forest passage has been cut down.
The voice of the howling of the shepherds: for their magnificence has been devastated. The voice of the roaring of the lions: because the arrogance of the Jordan has been devastated.
Thus says the Lord my God: Feed the flock of the slaughter,
which those who possessed them cut down, and they did not feel sorrow, and they sold them, saying: “Blessed be the Lord; we have become wealthy. Even their shepherds did not spare them.”
And so, I will no longer spare the inhabitants upon the earth, says the Lord. Behold, I will deliver men, each one into the hand of his neighbor and into the hand of his king. And they will cut down the land, and I will not rescue it from their hand.
And I will pasture the flock of the slaughter, because of this, O poor of the flock. And I took to myself two staffs: the one I called Handsome, and the other I called Rope, and I pastured the flock.
And I cut down three shepherds in one month. And my soul became contracted concerning them, just as their soul also varied concerning me.
And I said: I will not pasture you. Whatever dies, let it die. And whatever is cut down, let it be cut down. And let the rest of them devour, each one the flesh of his neighbor.
And I took my staff, which was called Handsome, and I tore it apart, so as to invalidate my pact, which I had struck with all of the people.
And it became invalid in that day. And so they understood, just like the poor of the flock who stay close to me, that this is the word of the Lord.
And I said to them: If it is good in your eyes, bring me my wages. And if not, remain still. And they weighed for my wages thirty silver coins.
And the Lord said to me: Cast it towards the statuary, the handsome price at which I have been valued by them. And I took the thirty silver coins, and I cast them into the house of the Lord, towards the statuary.
And I cut short my second staff, which was called Rope, so that I might dissolve the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.
And the Lord said to me: Still they are to you the equipment of a foolish shepherd.
For behold, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, who will not visit what is forsaken, nor seek what is scattered, nor heal what is broken, nor nourish what remains standing, and he will consume the flesh of the fatted ones and break their hoofs.
O shepherd and idol, abandoning the flock, with a sword upon his arm and over his right eye: his arm will be withered by drought, and his right eye will be obscured by darkness.
The burden of the word of the Lord upon Israel. The Lord, stretching forth the heavens and founding the earth and forming the spirit of man within him, says:
Behold, I will set Jerusalem as a lintel of the effects of drunkenness to all the surrounding peoples, yet even Judah will be in the blockade against Jerusalem.
And this shall be: In that day, I will set Jerusalem as a burdensome stone to every people. All who will lift it up will be torn to pieces. And all the kingdoms of the earth will be gathered together against her.
In that day, says the Lord, I will strike every horse with stupor and his rider with madness. And I will open my eyes upon the house of Judah, and I will strike every horse of the people with blindness.
And the governors of Judah will say in their heart, “Let the inhabitants of Jerusalem be strengthened for me, in the Lord of hosts, their God.”
In that day, I will set the governors of Judah like a flaming furnace among wood, and like a flaming torch among hay. And they will devour, to the right and to the left, all the surrounding peoples. And Jerusalem will be inhabited again, in her own place, in Jerusalem.
And the Lord will save the tabernacles of Judah, just as in the beginning, so that the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem may not glorify themselves boastfully against Judah.
In that day, the Lord will protect the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and even he who will have offended from them, in that day, will be like David, and the house of David will be like that of God, just like an angel of the Lord in their sight.
And this shall be in that day: I will seek to crush all the Gentiles that come against Jerusalem.
And I will pour out upon the house of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of prayers. And they will look upon me, whom they have pierced, and they will mourn for him as one mourns for an only son, and they will feel sorrow over him, as one would be sorrowful at the death of a firstborn.
In that day, there will be a great lamentation in Jerusalem, like the lamentation of Hadadrimmon in the plain of Megiddo.
And the earth will mourn: families and families separately; the families of the house of David separately, and their women separately;
the families of the house of Nathan separately, and their women separately; the families of the house of Levi separately, and their women separately; the families of Shimei separately, and their women separately;
all the rest of the families, families and families separately, and their women separately.
In that day, there will be a fountain open to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for the washing of the transgressor and of the defiled woman.
And this shall be in that day, says the Lord of hosts: I will disperse the names of the idols from the earth, and they will not be remembered any longer. And I will take away the false prophets and the unclean spirit from the earth.
And this shall be: when any devotee will continue to prophesy, his father and his mother, who conceived him, will say to him, “You shall not live, because you have been speaking a lie in the name of the Lord.” And his father and his mother, his own parents, will pierce him, when he will prophesy.
And this shall be: In that day, the prophets will be confounded, each one by his own vision, when he will prophesy. Neither will they be covered with a garment of sackcloth in order to deceive.
But he will say, “I am not a prophet; I am a man of agriculture. For Adam has been my example from my youth.”
And they will say to him, “What are these wounds in the middle of your hands?” And he will say, “I was wounded with these in the house of those who love me.”
Awake, O spear, against my shepherd and against the man that clings to me, says the Lord of hosts. Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered. And I will turn my hand to the little ones.
And there will be in all the earth, says the Lord, two parts in it will be scattered and will pass away, and the third part will be left behind.
And I will lead the third part through fire, and I will burn them just as silver is burned, and I will test them just as gold is tested. They will call on my name, and I will heed them. I will say, “You are my people.” And they will say, “The Lord is my God.”
Behold, the days of the Lord will arrive, and your spoils will be divided in your midst.
And I will gather all the Gentiles in battle against Jerusalem, and the city will be captured, and the houses will be ravaged, and the women will be violated. And the central part of the city will go forth into captivity, and the remainder of the people will not be taken away from the city.
Then the Lord will go forth, and he will fight against those Gentiles, just as when he fought in the day of conflict.
And his feet will stand firm, in that day, upon the Mount of Olives, which is opposite Jerusalem towards the East. And the mount of Olives will be divided down its center part, towards the East and towards the West, with a very great rupture, and the center of the mountain will be separated towards the North, and its center towards the Meridian.
And you will flee to the valley of those mountains, because the valley of the mountains will be joined all the way to the next. And you will flee, just as you fled from the face of the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. And the Lord my God will arrive, and all the saints with him.
And this shall be in that day: there will not be light, only cold and frost.
And there will be one day, which is known to the Lord, not day and not night. And in the time of the evening, there will be light.
And this shall be in that day: the living waters will go out from Jerusalem, half of them towards the East sea, and half of them towards the furthest sea. They will be in summer and in winter.
And the Lord will be King over all the earth. In that day, there will be one Lord, and his name will be one.
And all the land will return even to the desert, from the hill of Rimmon to the South of Jerusalem. And she will be exalted, and she will dwell in her own place, from the gate of Benjamin even to the place of the former gate, and even to the gate of the corners, and from the tower of Hananel even to the pressing room of the king.
And they will dwell in it, and there will be no further anathema, but Jerusalem shall sit securely.
And this will be the plague by which the Lord will strike all the Gentiles that have fought against Jerusalem. The flesh of each one will waste away while they are standing on their feet, and their eyes will be consumed in their sockets, and their tongue will be consumed in their mouth.
In that day, there will be a great tumult from the Lord among them. And a man will take the hand of his neighbor, and his hand will be clasped upon the hand of his neighbor.
And even Judah will fight against Jerusalem. And the riches of all the Gentiles will be gathered together around them: gold, and silver, and more than enough garments.
And, like the ruin of the horse, and the mule, and the camel, and the donkey, and all the beasts of burden, which will have been in those encampments, so will be this ruination.
And all those who will be the remnant of all the Gentiles that came against Jerusalem, will go up, from year to year, to adore the King, the Lord of hosts, and to celebrate the feast of tabernacles.
And this shall be: whoever will not go up, from the families of the earth to Jerusalem, so as to adore the King, the Lord of hosts, there will be no showers upon them.
But if even the family of Egypt will go not up, nor approach, neither will it be upon them, but there will be ruin, by which the Lord will strike all the Gentiles, who will not go up to celebrate the feast of tabernacles.
This will be the sin of Egypt, and this will be the sin of all the Gentiles, who will not go up to celebrate the feast of tabernacles.
In that day, that which is on the bridle of the horse will be holy to the Lord. And even the cooking pots in the house of the Lord will be like holy vessels before the altar.
And every cooking pot in Jerusalem and Judah will be sanctified to the Lord of hosts. And all those who make sacrifices will come and take from them, and will cook with them. And the merchant will no longer be in the house of the Lord of hosts, in that day.

The word of the Lord that came to Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah.
While gathering, I will gather together all things from the face of the earth, says the Lord.
I will gather man and cattle; I will gather the flying things of the air and the fish of the sea. And the impious will be a catastrophe. And I will disperse men before the face of the earth, says the Lord.
And I will extend my hand over Judah and over all the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And I will disperse from this place the remnant of Baal, and the names of the administrators along with the priests,
and those who adore the military campaign over the ceiling of the sky, both those who adore and swear by the Lord, and those who swear by Melchom,
both those who turn aside from following after the Lord, and those who have not sought the Lord, nor inquired about him.
Be silent before the face of the Lord God. For the day of the Lord is near; for the Lord has prepared a victim, he has sanctified those he has called.
And this shall be: in the day of the victim of the Lord, I will visit upon the leaders, and upon the sons of the king, and upon all who have been clothed with strange garments.
And I will visit upon all who enter arrogantly over the threshold in that day, those who fill the house of the Lord their God with iniquity and deceit.
And this shall be in that day, says the Lord: the voice of an outcry from the fish gate, and a howling from the Second, and a great contrition from the hills.
Howl, inhabitants of the Pillar. All the people of Canaan have fallen silent. All were ruined who had been wrapped in silver.
And this shall be in that time: I will scrutinize Jerusalem with lamps, and I will visit upon the men who have become stuck in the dregs, who say in their hearts, “The Lord will not do good, and he will not do evil.”
And their strength will be in plundering, and their houses in the desert. And they will build houses and not dwell in them, and they will plant vineyards and not drink their wine.
The great day of the Lord is near; it is near and exceedingly swift. The voice of the day of the Lord is bitter; the strong will be tested there.
That day is a day of wrath, a day of tribulation and anguish, a day of calamity and misery, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and whirlwinds,
a day of the trumpet and the trumpet blast over fortified cities and over exalted ramparts.
And I will trouble men, and they will walk like the blind, because they have sinned against the Lord. And their blood will be poured out like soil, and their bodies like manure.
Neither their silver, nor their gold, will be able to free them in the day of the wrath of the Lord. All the land will be devoured in the fire of his zeal, for with all speed, he will bring to consummation every inhabitant of the land.
Assemble, be gathered together, O people not worthy to be loved.
Until the decree settles accounts, the day like dust is passing away, before which the wrath of the fury of the Lord may overcome you, before which the day of the anger of the Lord may overcome you.
Seek the Lord, all you meek of the earth; you who have been working are his judgment. Seek the just, seek the meek. So then, in some way, you might be hidden in the day of the fury of the Lord.
For Gaza will be destroyed, and Ashkelon will be in the desert; they will expel Ashdod at midday, and Ekron will be eradicated.
Woe to you who inhabit the coast of the sea, you people of perdition. The word of the Lord is over you, Canaan, the land of the Philistines, and I will disperse you, so that not one inhabitant will be left.
And the coastline of the sea will be a resting place for shepherds and a fence line for cattle.
And it will be the line of him who will remain from the house of Judah. There they will pasture. In the houses of Ashkelon, they will rest towards evening. For the Lord their God will visit them, and he will turn away their captivity.
I have heard about the disgrace of Moab and the blasphemies of the sons of Ammon, by which they have defamed my people and have been magnified beyond their borders.
Because of this, as I live, says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Moab will be like Sodom, and the sons of Ammon like Gomorrah, like the dryness of thorns, and piles of salt, and a desert, all the way to eternity. The remnant of my people will despoil them, and the residue of my nation will possess them.
This will come upon them for their arrogance, because they have blasphemed and have been magnified over the people of the Lord of hosts.
The Lord will be a horror over them, and he will reduce all the gods of the earth. And they will adore him, each man from his own place, all the islands of the Gentiles.
Even so, you Ethiopians, you will be executed by my sword.
And he will extend his hand over the North, and he will destroy Assur. And he will set the Beautiful in the wilderness, and in an impassable place, and like a desert.
And flocks will lie down in its midst, all the beasts of the Gentiles. And the pelican and the hedgehog will stay at its threshold; the voice of the singing bird will be at the window, with the crow above its threshold, for I will diminish her strength.
This is the glorious city, dwelling in trust, which said in her heart, “I am and there is no one other than me.” How has she become a lair for beasts in the desert? All who pass through her will hiss and wag their hand.
Woe to the provocatrix and the redeemed city, the dove.
She has not heeded the voice, nor has she accepted discipline. She has not trusted in the Lord; she did not draw near to her God.
Her leaders are in her midst like roaring lions. Her judges are evening wolves; they leave nothing for the morning.
Her prophets are crazed; men without faith. Her priests have polluted what is holy; they have acted unjustly against the law.
The just Lord is in their midst; he will not do iniquity. In the morning, in the morning, he will bring his judgment into the light, and it will not be hidden. But the impious one has not known shame.
I have dispersed the nations, and their towers have been torn down. I have made their ways deserts, until there were none who passed through. Their cities have become desolate, with no man remaining, nor any inhabitant.
I said: Nevertheless, you will fear me; you will accept discipline. And her dwelling place will not perish, despite all the things about which I have visited her. Yet truly, they arose with the dawn and corrupted all their thoughts.
Because of this, expect me, says the Lord, in the day of my resurrection in the future, for my judgment is to gather together the Gentiles, and to collect the kingdoms, and to pour out over them my indignation, all the fury of my anger. For by the fire of my zeal, all the earth will be devoured.
For then I will restore to the people a chosen lip, so that all may invoke the name of the Lord and may serve him with one shoulder.
From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia, my supplicants, the sons of my diaspora, will carry a gift to me.
In that day, you will not be ashamed over all of your inventions, by which you have transgressed against me. For then I will take away from your midst your arrogant boasters, and you will no longer be exalted on my holy mountain.
And I will bequeath into your midst a poor and needy people, and they will hope in the name of the Lord.
The remnant of Israel will not do iniquity, nor speak lies, and a deceitful tongue will not be found in their mouth. For they will pasture and will recline, and there will be no one to strike them with terror.
Give praise, daughter of Zion. Shout joyfully, Israel. Rejoice and exult with all your heart, daughter of Jerusalem.
The Lord has taken away your judgment; he has turned aside your foes. The king of Israel, the Lord, is in your midst; you shall no longer fear evil.
In that day, it will be said to Jerusalem, “Do not be afraid,” and to Zion, “Do not let your hands be weakened.”
The Lord your God is the strength in your midst; he will save. He will rejoice over you with gladness. In his love, he will be silent. He will exult over you with praise.
The triflers who withdrew from the law, I will gather together, because they were from you, so that you may no longer suffer disgrace over them.
Behold, I will execute all who have afflicted you in that time, and I will save those who are lame, and I will gather together her who had been cast out. And I will place them in praise and in renown, in all the land where they had been put to shame,
in that time, when I will lead to you, and in the time when I will gather for you. For I will deliver you into renown and into praise, among all the peoples of the earth, when I will have converted your captivity before your very eyes, says the Lord.
